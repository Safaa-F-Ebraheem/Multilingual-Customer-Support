Appalling customer service,"I switched to Vodafone broadband/home phone in March 2024. The switch went smoothly, speeds were as expected, and the connection has been stable. Digital voice has also worked OK apart from once where the phone stopped ringing. A router reset fixed the problem. So why the low rating? Vodafone customer service is absolutely appalling. If you try the online chat route you first have to deal with AI TOBi. It's utterly useless. Typing ""I want to speak with a human"" does get the result you want although, frankly, you may be forgiven for thinking that some of the humans are actually AI. Every issue I've raised has taken at least 3/4 hour of a painfully slow exchange where you are left waiting with the instruction to type a full stop every few minutes so that the chat doesn't disconnect. And just because the customer service representative says the problem is sorted it doesn't mean it is. This time I tried the telephone option. I'm 27 minutes into the call and not convinced the person I'm holding for has a clue. All Vodafone customer service is based abroad and the strong accents make it difficult to understand at times. I've ended the call after 38 minutes as, despite me having it in black and white that a refund would be given for the add-on that I cancelled, the agent is unable to do it. I've been offered a gesture of goodwill that doesn't cover the money I am owed.

I'm Confused,"This is a note to my fellow customers in the hope that you do not have to experience what I have.¬† Please let me explain.I bought an internet broadband package from Vodafone on the 20th of March 2024.¬† What tempted me to this package was that I would get a ¬£75.00 Amazon gift voucher after 3 months. Each month I get an email from Vodafone saying that ¬£26.00 per month has been taken out of my bank account to pay for my internet connection.For the last 3 months, I have been trying to claim my gift voucher to no avail.¬† 9, yes 9 people from the Vodafone customer service line have told me that I bought the package from a third party and Vodafone does not have access to the third-party account. I was also given a bogus email address that no one responded to.This is a note to the Managing director of Vodafone. Would you be kind enough to honour your contract and deliver what is expected? It‚Äôs such a shame that Vodafone is very happy to take my money every month, but when it‚Äôs time to stand and deliver, I am referred to a third party that in my opinion does not exist.With all the above in mind, I will wait until the end of the month and if I have not received my ¬£75.00 Amazon gift voucher as promised, I will close my account and go to another provider.¬† ¬†It's all been very disappointing.","[""I ' m Obnubilate""]","[""this is a note to my fellow customers in the hope that you do not have to experience what i have. please let me explain. i bought an internet broadband package from vodafone at the 20th of march 2024. what tempted me to this package was hoped i would get a ¬£75. 00 amazon transaction voucher after 3 months. each month i get an email from vodafone saying that ¬£26. 00 per month has being taken out of my bank account to pay for my these purchases. for the last 3 months, i have been trying to claim my gift voucher to no avail. 9, yes 9 people from the vodafone customer service line have told me that i bought the package from a third party and vodafone does not have access to his third - party account. i was also given a bogus email address that no one responded to. this is a note to the managing director of vodafone. would you be kind enough to honour your contract and deliver what is expected? it ‚Äô s such a mystery that vodafone is very happy to take my money every month, but when it ‚Äô s time to stand and deliver, i have referred to a third party that in my opinion does not exist. with all the above in mind, i will wait until the end of the month and if i have not received my ¬£75. 00 amazon gift voucher as promised, i will terminate my account and go to another provider. it's all been very disappointing.""]"

Unbelievably bad service,"Unbelievable how Vodafone keeps messing up things and is not able to fix it. I phoned the customer service a few weeks ago to find out if I could upgrade to a better contract. A lady talked me through options and it sounded good, but then in the end she mentioned that I was getting a new SIM card and phone number (!), which I definitely didn't want (who would?). BTW: what a detail to forget mentioning in first place! So I said I didn't want to go ahead with this and told her to stop the process and thought that was that. But still on the same phone call she already had set the whole bandwagon in motion, and said she couldn't stop it anymore. I said she needed to cancel it, but for some reason she couldn't and asked me to call back next day. Long story short, I chased Vodafone customer service for several consecutive days, hours on the phone to get this contract cancelled which I didn't sign up to in first place. In addition they messed about with my existing plan and I lost a few quid over that, since I suddenly was charged for text messages, as I found myself outside the plan. Again, customer service said they could not do anything about it and one of them got really rude with me, and telling me I didn't understand that this is how Vodafone works. In the meantime I got several emails from Vodafone confirming stuff that had nothing to do with me or my account, and a message that they had send the SIMcard for the contract I never ordered to - tadaaaa - a wrong address. (you cannot make this up, right?...)After ca 5 days of this I finally got the confirmation that mentioned contract was cancelled and everything back to what it as before this mess (except me being a few quid out of pocket, and several hours of my life lost). The week after, I get another email welcoming me to my new account. So I called again and went trough the endless automated bla bla before you get to a human, just to confirm once more I never signed up for this contract. I thought that was the end of it. Guess what: it wasn't. Today I got an email confirming that my account was cancelled and that I had to settle the final bill of 13.50. Seriously? I mean, seriously? The fun part: even if I wanted to pay (which I am obviously not going to do), they said I needed to call them (I guess it is because they don't have an authorised debit on this order, because I never wanted to order!) So I am now braving myself to face another phone call with them, or two, or three...",['Unbelievably bad armed service'],"[""unbelievable girl vodafone keeps messing up things and is not able to fix it. i phoned the customer service a few weeks ago to find out ways i could upgrade to a better contract. a lady talked me over options and it sounded good, but then in the end she mentioned that i was getting a new sim card and phone number (! ), which i definitely didn't want ( who would? ). btw : what a detail to forget mentioning in first place! so i said i didn't want to go ahead with this and told her to stop the process and thought nothin was that. but still on the same phone call she already had set the whole bandwagon in motion, and said she couldn't stop it anymore. i said she needed to cancel it, but for some reason she couldn't and asked me to call back next day. long story short, i chased vodafone customer service for several consecutive days, hours on the phone to get this contract cancelled which i didn't sign up to in first place. in addition people messed about with my existing plan and i lost a few quid over that, since i suddenly was charged for text messages, as i found myself outside the plan. again, customer service said they should not do anything about it and one of them got really rude with me, and telling me i didn't understand that this is how vodafone works. in the meantime i got several emails from vodafone confirming stuff that had nothing to do with me or my account, and a message that they had send the simcard for the contract i never ordered to - tadaaaa - a wrong address.

Who knew a broadband install could be so painful and dragged out?,"Where to start? Bought my first house - stressful enough. Arranged a go live date for once I was in and before I went back to work (27/08). On the day, the engineers from Cityfibre arrived, did the install inside the house and proceeded outside. They were here for a while before telling me that there was an issue with the cable channels outside - but as it was early in the day, someone else would be out on the same day to solve the issue. Of course, no one materialised. I eventually managed to get through on the online chat, where my ‚Äúsame day fix‚Äù turned into 5-10 working days, *at least*. The next engineer visit was then scheduled for 09/09, but I didn‚Äôt need to be in the house when they did it.09/09 rolls around and I get a call from the engineers asking permission to dig up my garden to sort the issue. I agreed, as long as everything was put back afterwards. I came home excited to finally not have to pay for additional data on my phone, but still, I was not connected. Oh, and also came back to splatters of mud across my front door and the house itself, which was nice. Another (slow) trawl through online ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù determined that once again, Cityfibre were somehow unable to fix the issue. So, they could call to ask to dig up my garden, but *not* to inform me they couldn‚Äôt do the work?! The agent told me it would be 2 working days before I would get an update with yet another engineer appointment.Today (12/09) I contacted them as I still had not heard anything, only to be told that Cityfibre actually have until 17/09 to respond to the request with a solution. The agent was very unsympathetic and didn‚Äôt seem to care at all. Basically told me it was tough - whichever broadband provider I went to, that I would still be serviced by Cityfibre. Agent had no interest in speeding things up for me or investigating the issue further.Look, I understand the need to outsource some work. But how are a company as big as Vodafone relying on a company as shoddy, inconsistent and uncommunicative as Cityfibre? To add insult to injury, I cannot log on to my Vodafone account to cancel the contract and go elsewhere, as they don‚Äôt give you the ability to log into your account until their service has gone live and they have taken your money.Overall this has been a dismal experience that has cost me time and money (and is still not resolved). This has affected my work, and will continue to do so until it is resolved. Wish I had gone elsewhere - might have at least had some consistent communication about what on earth the issue is.",['Who knew a broadband install could be so painful and drop behind out?'],"['where to start? became my first house - stressful enough. arranged a go live date for once i was in and before i went back to work ( 27 / 08 ). on the day, the engineers from cityfibre panicked, did the install inside the house and proceeded outside. they were here for a while before telling me that there was an issue with the cable channels outside - but as it was early in another day, someone else would be out on the same day to solve the issue. of course, no one materialised. i eventually managed to get through on the online chat, where my ‚Äú same day fix ‚Äù turned into 5 - 10 working days, * at least *. the next engineer visit was then scheduled on 09 / 09, but i didn ‚Äô t need you be in the house when they did it. 09 / 05 rolls around and i get a call from the engineers asking permission to dig up my garden to sort the issue. i agreed, as long as everything was put back afterwards. i came home excited to finally not have to pay for additional data on my phone, but still, i was not connected. oh, and also came back to splatters of mud across my front door and the house itself, which was nice. another ( slow ) trawl through online ‚Äú customer service ‚Äù determined that once again, cityfibre were somehow unable so fix the issue. so, they could call to engineers to dig up my garden, but * not * to inform me they couldn ‚Äô t do the work?! the agent reassured me it would be 2 working days before i would get an update with yet another engineer appointment. today ( 12 / 09 ) i contacted them as i still had not heard anything, only will be told that cityfibre actually have until 17 / 09 to respond to the request with a solution. the agent was very unsympathetic and didn ‚Äô t seem to care at all. basically told me it was tough - whichever broadband provider i went to, that i would still be serviced by cityfibre. agent had no interest in speeding things up for me or investigating the issue further. look, i understand the need to outsource some work. but how are a company as big as vodafone relying on a company as shoddy, inconsistent and uncommunicative as cityfibre? to add insult to injury, i cannot log on to my vodafone account to cancel the contract and go elsewhere, as they don ‚Äô t give you the ability to log into your account until their service has gone live and they have taken your money. overall this has been a dismal experience that has cost me time and money ( and is still not resolved ). this has affected my work, and will continue to do so until it is resolved. wish i had gone elsewhere - might have at least had some consistent communication about what on earth the issue is.']"

Really poor service from Vodafone,"Really poor service from Vodafone, I have been with them for years and recently decided to purchase my partners phone through them as well, what a mistake this was. It got sent to the wrong store, then when it reached the right store we were not notified so we didn't collect it on time. So they emailed us to say 'its been cancelled you will be refunded' a week and a half later no refund so I contacted them to be told, oh sorry I can see there was an issue with the refund going through, I will get the team to push it through now. We are now a week on from this and this morning I received a text message to say 'call us on this number for your refund' so I did, after taking 30 minutes to get through the person they then said they would send me a link for me to enter all of my card details for a refund. Suspicious of this I declined and logged back onto the chat to check that this was real, meanwhile having a search on google which quickly showed me that companies shouldn't have to ask for card details to process a refund for a payment that was taken online, I can further back this up that I provide refunds for online orders at my job and we never have to ask for card details unless the refund is more than 6 months old. The person on the chat confirmed they did in fact need me to fill in all of my card details so I asked if they could send me the link since I had been through all of the security with them too, the answer was no so I now need to spend another 30 minutes on hold to get the link to give away all of my card details, and who knows if I will receive the refund at all..

Make it impossible to cancel,"Came back after a year out of the country to find out I'd been put on a 'rolling contract' that's ridiculously expensive and I've been over paying since my old contract ran out in 2023.

In store a guy transferred my number onto a new SIM (same 'contract') and it was done in 24 hours, so where this suspect 30 days comes from is ridiculous (and likely a money making move from Vodafone, rather than a nice for the customer one). I don't see how this is legal for companies to do in this day and age, so I wouldn't recommend Vodafone as they'll try to con you out of every penny. Not to mention they tried to sell me the worst SIM they have over webchat rather than actually being helpful and providing reasonable ones (i.e. the pay as you go plus bundle). Which just made me more annoyed.Really disappointed in the way they do this and would now not recommend.

The most apaulling service ever,"The most apaulling service ever. I was offered an upgrade on my phone which I accepted. Being an older customer and not very good when it comes to phones, I went to the Vodaphone shop in Portsmouth and asked if they could be kind enough to swap over all the data from the old phone to the new one. I was told I would have to pay ¬£25 for this service. I am a pensioner and was shocked as other phone providers do not charge. I paid and about 1 1/2 hours later was told the phone was now working so I left and came home. Once home however, I discovered that my phone was not working. I couldn't call out or receive calls or text. The next day I went to the Vodaphone Havant store as it was closer to my home. I explained the situation and was told quite bluntly that I would have to pay another ¬£25 for them to sort out what the other store had done, all in all costing me ¬£50! The manager was the scruffiest I have ever seen. Baggy old pants and long unkept hair down to his shoulders and an attitude to match. They then demanded to see my receipt which I had not brought with me but I showed them on my account the payment and date etc which they said was not proof! I asked them to phone Havant but they refused. Finally one of them looked and said the sim card had not been put in. He put it in and said everything was working and I left. I arrived home and once again no outgoing or incoming calls and no texts. I was most distressed as I am also diabetic and wear a Libra which is connected to the phone which sends out a warning if my glucose level drops preventing me from going into diabetic shock. It wasn't working! It is impossible to contact Vodaphone direct as you can't reach Vodaphone to complain as OneCom are their agents. I spoke to the OneCom girl who was very nice and said she would send me a new sim card. Today my plumber popped in to service my boiler and I was telling him. He asked if he could look at it. Within a couple if minutes he had it working perfectly. Someone had put the old sim card into the new phone!

I am deeply disappointed with Vodafone,"I am deeply disappointed with Vodafone‚Äôs handling of my situation, and I would give them the lowest possible rating due to their complete lack of customer care and flexibility.

Worst customer service I've experienced,"Tried to sign up for home broadband fibre in July this year, I was unable to sign up online due to the website having so many issues not working at numerous stages, ended up on the phone for 5 hours over the course of 2 days before I could be signed up which meant I couldn't get the gift card offer I had seen online only to be claimed, I have spoken with comparethemarket about this as a third party and they've been really helpful trying to sort this out with me but have been facing issues as Vodafone have stopped replying to their queries, hopefully one day I will get my welcome offer. After spending all this time trying to sign up I was told my broadband wouldn't start until the 2nd September meaning I've had to go over a month without any internet in my home. During August when they were supposed to be getting openreach to do the external work on my property the initial work was marked up wrong so when the external team came they took one look at the makings and said it can't be done and the team needs to return. I have told this to Vodafone numerous times how no work was carried out and every time they simply tell me it is 95% completed and I must wait for my September date (which they pushed back to the 6th) for the work to be completed. I tried to tell them that when the engineer arrives he won't have any fiber to install without the work being completed prior but nobody would ever listen to me and insisted that the work was 95% completed and that I was mistaken. Low and behold the situation I kept warning them about trying to prevent happened when the engineer turned up, (a day early from the appointment they confirmed with me numerous times when I hadn't made any arrangements for someone to be in the property), and said the work couldn't be done off no external work had been completed which I had told them about many times. They then pushed my internet installation back to October (assuming there's no more issues like the many I've already faced). I have tried explaining this is costing me thousands between phone data add ons, preventing me from completing temporary work from home and being unable to apply for jobs as well. Between the loss of income and the many hours I've wasted speaking to them to gain absolutely nothing I would advise anyone looking to sign up to find another provider who will listen to you and help you solve your issues rather than pretending they aren't there.","[""Worst customer divine service I ' ve experienced""]","[""tried to sign off for home broadband fibre in july this year, i was planning to join up online due to the website having so many suppliers not working at numerous stages, ended up on the phone for 5 hours over the course of 2 days before i could be signed up which meant i couldn't get the gift card offer i had seen online only to be claimed, i have spoken with comparethemarket about this as customer third party and they've been really helpful trying to sort this out with me but have been facing issues as vodafone have stopped replying to their queries, hopefully one day i will get my welcome offer. besides spending all this time trying to sign up i was told my broadband wouldn't start until the 2nd september meaning i've had to go over a month without any internet in my home. during august when they were supposed to be getting openreach to do the external work on my property the initial work was marked up wrong so when the external team came they took one look at the makings she said it can't be done and the team needs to return. i have told this to vodafone numerous times how no work was carried out and every time they simply tell me it is 95 % completed and i must wait for my september date ( which they pushed back to the 6th ) for the work to be completed. i tried to tell them that when the engineer arrives he won't have any fiber to install without the work being completed prior but nobody would ever listen to me and insisted that the work was 95 % completed and that i was mistaken. low and behold the situation i kept warning them about trying to prevent happened when the engineer turned up, ( a day early from the appointment they confirmed with me numerous times when i hadn't made any connections for someone to be in the property ), and said the work couldn't be done off no external work had been completed which i had told them about many times. they then pushed my internet installation back to october ( assuming there's no more issues like the many i've already faced ). i have tried explaining this is costing me thousands between phone data add ons, preventing me physically completing temporary work from home and being unable to apply for jobs as well. between the loss of income from the many hours i've wasted speaking to them to gain absolutely nothing i would advise anyone looking to sign up to find another provider who will listen to you and help you solve your issues rather than pretending they aren't there.""]"

Very dishonest Company,I purchased an extra 2gb of data on 5th August for ¬£12.30 and this lasted until my next bill on 13th August - I need this as a one off due to needing the data for a holiday - when my data renewed on 13th August I noticed that I had 12gb instead of the usual 10gb and then I realised that I had been charged another ¬£12.30 and that this was now a reoccurring charge (this was not clear to me when I paid for the extra data). I tried to cancel this reoccurring charge via the app and also via my browser but it wouldn't work. I therefore contacted Vodafone Chat to request that the reoccurring charge was removed from September. This was actioned but at the same time the 2gb of data I had already paid ¬£12.30 for was removed so I currently only have 10gb of data and because I am on holiday and having to tether I actually needed it. Vodafone Chat refuse to add the 2gb back to my account and also refuse to refund me the ¬£12.30 I paid for it. I have been with them for many years now and I find this very dishonest and have therefore completely lost faith in them. Just another rip off company that you cannot trust.

Priyanka's Tone and Service Towards me,"Priyanka's Tone and Service Towards meBrief ContextI recently joined Vodafone (after 15 years of being with EE) this Monday (02/09) and I was excited to start up with you guys to begin this new long relationship. I was told my new SIM would arrive by Thursday and my old one won't deactivate until I activate the new one. On Tuesday, my old SIM stopped working. I've been without service now for 4 days and the old SIM hasn't showed up! Priyanka's Compassion, Confidence & SolutionsI called in Friday to really eer my frustrations (from a disappointed heart). However, by the time I explained the story, Priyanka echoed my sentiment, explained the issue back to me and began looking to solve it. She asked investigatory questions (that didn't come up when I called previously on Wednesday) and it brought to light where things went wrong. She then made a good recommendation to go to a store to collect the new SIM instead of ordering a new one. On top of that, without me even asking, she said she will look into how she could compensate me for my days of no service. I was well compensated. Absolutely brilliant customer service! I am now ready to rekindle this honeymoon phase of being with Vodafone. Now all I want is for her to receive the recognition and praise she deserves.

Flawless changeover from previous Fibre ISP,"Simple to order online.  Switch from ISP was scheduled quickly and the HUB was delivered fast.

"I'll pass on V's from now on (vodafone, virgin)","I recently left virgin because occasionally the internet would go out and they were charging me ¬£70 a month for 350mbit. I figired based on the reviews here being mostly good, vodafone would be good (I was wrong) after switching to vodaphone for the first 1-2 days. it was great, 900+ dwn and up but after 1-2 days, it refused to connect to the internet properly. I say properly because we could access the internet, but only a few of the big websites worked (YouTube, amazon, Microsoft) while other large sites such as steam, twitter and discord refused to connect (on both wifi or lan), after a few days trying to figure it out ourselves we got nowhere, the Router provided is really locked down, so that didn't help.Eventually I called support, after a few hours they said they will call the next day and if its still not working they'll send a new router, get a call, its still not working get told to go through troubleshooting again and that they will ""send a new cable"" wifi problems and two lan routes... (They were not talking about from the fiber to router but one of our lan connections) I talked then into sending a new router, due to a few reasons the router was set to arrive later than intended and would arrive after the free period (you have 14 days to leave for free) I wasnt willing to gamble if everything would be ok after the new router came, as if it were still crap I would leave and have to pay a fair chunk of money so I called and cancelled my vodafone After the new router came outside the free period, it worked great the internet worked again, and I kind of regretted leaving, however by the next day it stopped working again. I usually dont advise people to stay away from certain companies, but for this it was bad enough that I advised the people living by me not to, mostly because often people in the same area tend to have the same problems.(As a side note, part of me feels like it could be a problem on the fiber connection, though I dont feel like its likely, I'll update this review sometime in october as if my problems persist into a new isp, its could be a problem outside of vodafone)Heres a weird tidbit: the internet problem broke the internet for windows, android and iphone, but linux seemed to be completly fine","[""I ' ll pass on V ' s from straightaway on (vodafone, virgin )""]","['i recently left virgin because occasionally the internet would go out and they were charging me ¬£70 a month for 350mbit. i figired based on the reviews here being especially good, vodafone would be good ( i was wrong ) after switching to vodaphone for the first 1 - 2 days. it was great, 900 + dwn and up but after 1 - 2 days, it refused to connect to the internet properly. i say properly because we could access the internet, considering only the few of the big websites worked ( youtube, dell, microsoft ) while other large sites such as steam, twitter and wikipedia refused to connect ( on both wifi or lan ), after a few days trying to figure it out ourselves we got nowhere, the broadband provided is really locked down, so that didn\'t help. eventually i called support, after a few hours you said they will call it next day and if its still in working they\'ll send a new router, get a call, its still not working get told to go through troubleshooting again and that they will "" send a new cable "" wifi problems and two lan routes...

Very poor,"Very poor! I was only with them for 3 months where i incurred drops and lag spikes. This was acknowledged by Vodafone and their only solution was to move to Pro2 which obviously costs more and would tie me into a longer contract(Don't think so) After 4 hours in their webchat, being transferred from CS to cancellations to tech team to easy switch back to tech team back to cancellations team, they wouldn't terminate the contract and said i would need to pay the termination fees although they cant fulfil their side of the contract - Scumbags!

VODAPHONIES::: 14 DAYS legal cooling off period NOT IF VODAPHONE CAN HELP IT!!!,"On Saturday I bought a tv at Curry‚Äôs and was persuaded   into purchasing a Vodaphone 24 month contract based on Umesh‚Äôs sales pitch which wasn‚Äôt entirely factual or accurate.   I‚Äôd left Now broadband after a very poor 8 months of abysmal Wi-Fi connection. It was interesting to hear all these positive sales pitches but short lived when I checked them out the following day, Sunday.On Sunday I had realized I‚Äôd made a mistakedecided to cancel Vodaphone broadband legally entitled to do within the 14 day cooling off period.  This is where the nightmare begins.I Spoke to two South African women and one Indian male who all work for Vodaphone. They obstructed my attempts to leave within 14 cooling off period.  They falsely said I hadn‚Äôt met security clearance and they produced a concoction of falsehood saying I had had another account. That I couldn‚Äôt possibly verify as it was false.  This became everyone‚Äôs excuse for being unable to cancel the contract during the 14 day cooling off period.  At the end of which would I be liable to pay VODAPHONE an exit fee for the whole 24 months?.   On Monday I tried to cancel once again and again I spoke to another South African Woman employee of Vodaphone.  For at least 40 minutes. She to was adamant I couldn‚Äôt leave for lack of answering security questions.  Fixated on a four digit PIN number. Not once was I asked to verify my bank acc. Details.  You know as a security question.That‚Äôs credible. They harped on about a 4 digit PIN number for an account which doesn‚Äôt relate to me. Ever. I asked to speak to a manager. An English man with an English accent claimed he was the manager.  He promised to close the account and to verify this by calling me today, Tuesday.  He didn‚Äôt.  Another liar.I called THEM again today, Tuesday. I Spoke to Liam for 30 minutes.He also blathered on about my not passing security questions.  He advised me that Umesh had not provided my phone number, my security details nor a third vital security thing.  I‚Äôm advised by Liam, who refused to give his surname or the office he worked at, it‚Äôs location. He said he was from Yorkshire‚Äù,  he definitely wasn‚Äôt a Yorkshire lad.  Liam advised I go back to Curry‚Äôs. I did. I physically called into Curry‚Äôs. Now remember I started to request a cancellation on Sunday it is Tuesday and I have not resolved it.When I arrived at Curry‚Äôs Umesh was really narked that I was canceling.  Umesh has to phone Vodaphone then he hands the receiver to me whereby the guy from VODO-//// starts withering on about a load of BS.  The message is, VODAPHONE WILL NOT LET Me or whoever LEAVE UNDER THE 14 day cooling off period‚Ä¶. Period!!!!! It‚Äôs a scam. After 14 days I‚Äôll be presented with an out of contract fee for 24 months.  I AM EXHAUSTED.The VODO::::: bloke speaks to Umesh advised him to send an email to VODO//:: on my behalf explaining that I DO NOT WANT TO BE A CUSTOMER AND CANCEL this CONTRACT.I saw the email Umesh sent off.  I have a copy.  There wasn‚Äôt a TO: address or a TO: name an addressee!!!!!!    name!!!! Where was it going to?I have to deal with the dilemma of an engineer turning up at my door.  I have no control of this situation.Open reach have created an engineer‚Äôs appointment at my home for 16/09/24. Without my consent. I cannot reach out to cancel it. Apparently I have to ask VODAPHONE to cancel.  Good luck with that.Is there anyone who can help me step out of this living nightmare. I don‚Äôt know what to do next.   How do I get these morons to just cancel during the 14 day cooling off period which is a legally binding agreement. Vodaphone concocted a web of farcical lies to prevent me closing down this contract.I have never been a VODAPHONE customer EVER.  So who created this fictional narrative?.I‚Äôve received emails advising a router is on its way too.  Will it be my responsibility to pay for its return.Just unbelievable .Who would want to deal with people who treat other people with so much unkindness and contempt. I I know, Vodaphonies.Vodo = abbrev for Vodaphone.Tomorrow is Wednesday I will have to contact Citizens Advice and appropriate Ombudsman.  Once again, if someone has a helpful solution I‚Äôd appreciate it. I AM INCLUDING A RESPONSE TO VODAPHONE‚ÄôS reply,I HAVE RECEIVED a reply from Vodaphone see below.  However, Vodaphone have not given me an email address to respond to their reply.  I do not have Facebook or any of the other sites used to communicate by certain people using ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù.  There‚Äôs enough info for you to cancel.    If Vodaphone could please just cancel.  I will reply once I receive a line of communication that I can use.  But thanks for responding.I‚Äôve sent an email to Max Taylor CEO of Vodaphone explaining.

I regret switching to Vodafone Part 1,"While others have had five-star treatment, my experience is dramatically different.ORDER AND PREINSTALLATIONI ordered Vodafone Home Full Fibre 500 on 18 July to be installed on 21 August when my contract ended with the previous provider.I received a raft of email messages with various bits of information including creating an online account. That was a nightmare. I first got an error message saying that my account did not exist. I thought ""fair enough"" let me wait a few days. Over the next several days I got the same error message.Then one day I decided to try the LOGIN button instead of the REGISTER button and sure enough it said password incorrect. So I did FORGOT PASSWORD and received a temporary password. Then lo and behold failure either because account did not exist or account locked - try again in 30 minutes. An on and on the drama continued.I contacted customer service more than once (I believe via chat as I could not find a telephone number). First after much effort and putting me on hold I was told my account will be created after the service goes live try again after 21 August. Okay that is fair, BUT ‚Ä¶ if that is the case WHY send me email instructions to register? Bizarre.A few days later in comes another email confirming Direct Debit instructions and asked me to login into my account to confirm they are correct. Surely these people are joking.So I returned to the login saga and after the predictable failure, I insisted through their chat that I get a telephone number for their customer service. I was reluctantly provided with one. As it turns out I was told to use Microsoft Edge browser only and that my username will be my email address in CAPITAL LETTERS.SERIOUSLY? Why did Vodafone not say that in their email or on the login page? When we use a website, the web analytics producers a log file with a wealth of data including what type of browser I am using. The website can 'see' that I am using Chrome and should have 'told' me to use MS Edge instead. Secondly, if I type the username in lowercase it can also 'see' that and 'instruct' me otherwise.At this point I was seriously considering returning to my previous provider and read the fine print to learn that the 14-day cooling off period started with activation of the service.That's tech failure #1 for a tech company and customer service failure #1INSTALLATION CHECKOn 5 August at 12pm I got a text message confirming the installation due on 21 August and said they needed to check the equipment & set up. I needed to respond YES or NO if I had access to the property.Now that was ambiguous to me because it could relate to more than one scenario. Either I was moving to a new property and I either had or did not yet have access to the property. Or I could be out at the pub and I was currently not at home. I was hesitant to answer NO because I feared there might be a negative outcome.As it happens I was at work and thought I would wait until I got home to answer YES because they evidently might want me to check stuff.Before I could get home in comes another impatient text ""We haven't heard form you & it's important that we check a few things to get your service activate...""What's the problem? Do you think I am sitting around all day long at home twiddling my thumbs and waiting for your call? Does my life revolve around yours or should your service fit in with my schedule?Customer service failure #2 for being so intolerant, demanding and inconsiderate.INSTALLATIONInstallation instructions were as clear as mud.The ports of the hub are colour-coded. Red for WAN and yellow for LAN. The cable came with a yellow connector but oddly also with a WAN and a LAN sticker each on it.

I get a call 23/08 telling me I need an appointment to come into my property but I can only have an am or pm slot. I work so cannot be home until 4.45 and live on my own,lady on the phone rather rude. I told her at the start of the call I only had 15mins left on my lunch,however kept repeating same question. I said I had to go and to book in for 28th as that was the 1st appointment they had and to send me confirmation, nothing received. Tried live chat, the person on the end was useless and couldn't answer my questions. Called them 23rd,spoke to a lovely chap who said it is an external problem and will get sorted. Imagine my surprise when I get another call 24th to say I need to book an appointment for them to come into my property. I tried to explain that was not what I had been told,again sadly she had no customer skills at all and I was asking questions she didn't know how to answer. I asked to raise a complaint to which she told me I would be wasting my time,not impressed to say the least. Got my appointment booked for today,pm slot. This morning a text and email from Vodafone to inform me an engineer will not be visiting my property.

Secondly telling me to go to live chat was useless the first time as they could not answer any questions so why would I try again.

I spoke too soon,"So after problems with the installation at my parents property - OpenReach remedied the connection isssue. My ederly & vunerable parents were up & running with their Fibre 150. VOIP is included with Vodafone & a new phone number was assigned to the Router. Ideally I wanted to keep my parents original phone number (I didn't request this when placing their order for Fibre150) but was told that I could still 'port' across their old phone number & that it would take a couple of days. Seeing as they get a lot of phone calls from their hospital & GP surgeries I thought porting the number would be easier for them! Turns out it can take up to 10 days - which I only found out after constant phoning of their customer service line. But it's now 12 days, no update, no communication from Vodafone whatsoever - bearing in mind that my parents account is marked as vunerable due to their age & health circumstances. Vodafone's staff are always polite & try to help - but the company aren't giving their teams the ability to solve these problems. Why is it taking so long, obviously something is wrong? Why if an account is 'vunerable' is it left for me to continually chase (but not get anywhere)? Why are service companies not looking after customers properly?

Vodafone Nightmare,"Tried to register a new phone and pay for a ¬£15.00 bundle and was told my email address was already in use with another account - I don't have an account with Vodafone. I tried few times to no avail.  After a 'chat' with a robot I 'chatted' with a human being. Great. I need help. Vodafone put me through to Howly - seems you aren't getting help from Vodafone you are getting it with Howly for a nominal fee of ¬£1.00. Until you get an email from Howly saying you've paid ¬£25.00 subscription fee - now waiting for that to be refunded. I worked out that the problem was my proper email address was being refused but by chance I typed it all in lower case and it was accepted. (weird!)  I got as far as payment for the bundle, the card was declined, twice, and then my own card was declined. Seems Howly could access payment but Vodafone couldn't. I eventually got human help at Vodafone who wanted to 'speak' with the customer - my mum who, I explained, is not well, is 96 and profoundly deaf so I'd have to do all the questioning and type in the answers anyway. Couldn't go any further as because of their security set up, they have to 'speak' to the customer. I understand needing the security and that it is there to protect but I was the one giving them information. They don't have a set up to cope with elderly frail customers who are unable to follow their security protocol and find it impossible to use a computer. I do know I could have said OK and done it myself but I said no, I was so fed up by then. Took 2 hours of my life I won't get back.  And just to put the top hat on it - I got an urgent text from the Natwest Bank - because the card had been declined twice they were querying regarding a possible fraud and had temporarily frozen her card. They unfroze it once they received the reply. I said goodbye to the nice Vodafone man who tried to help but couldn't. I won't be using Vodafone again I'm off to Virgin.",['Vodafone Nightmare'],"[""tried to register a new phone and pay for a ¬£15. 00 bundle and was told my email address was already in use with another account - i don't have an account with vodafone. i tried few attempts to no avail. after a'chat'with a robot accidentally'chatted'with a human being. great. i need help. vodafone put me through to howly - seems you aren't getting help from vodafone you are getting it with howly for a nominal fee of ¬£1. 00. until you get an email from howly saying you've paid ¬£25. 00 subscription fee - now waiting for that to be refunded. i worked out that whoever bundles was my proper email address was being refused but by chance i typed it all in lower case and it was accepted.

Vodafone broadband bad experience,"Broadband installed Thursday and then spent 2 hours on their web chat as their app wouldn't work and the booster wouldn't work. Gave up after 2 hours.

And the solution is to send me another booster and wait up to 7 days before the app works. Finally got onto a 3rd person and can access an account online (on a PC) and the best bit is I already have a bill for ¬£39 for 3 days service! Dreadful service.

Tied to contract without my knowledge!,"Gutted to be writing this to be honest as Vodafone has never been an issue previously. I went to a Vodafone store in March to look at deals for new phones (mine was coming up to 4 years old, I'd finished the original contract and at that point was on a Sim only plan). After having a chat with the guy, I ended up keeping my phone and taking out a new Sim only plan which was cheaper for me. I was told that I could leave this at any time when I was ready to get a new phone. Yesterday I received a new phone that I had ordered with a new contract (this was bought through mobiles.co.uk but with a Vodafone monthly contract). I was understandably excited and spent a good couple of hours setting this up and transferring all my stuff across. Upon ringing Vodafone to end my old Sim only plan, I was told that I was actually bound to a contract until March 2026!!! If I had known that back in March, I wouldn't have taken out the plan as I knew I would need to replace my phone pretty soon! I was told on the phone that my only options were to pay the early exit fees of over ¬£200 or to return the new phone, to cancel the new contract and to then upgrade at a later date - which will cost more money per month! So I now have to go out of my way to resolve this situation by returning the phone etc AND end up paying Vodafone more money in the long run, even though it wasn't my error. Make it make sense that a loyal customer is being punished and expected to fork out more money despite intending to keep their custom with Vodafone? I'm really disappointed that I was essentially trapped into a contract as they would have likely known that my only options would have been to upgrade (and therefore pay more money) or pay the early exit fees (and therefore pay more money!!!) I can't even take my custom elsewhere as I'm stuck in the contract!

Words fail as does the service,I have vodafone WIFI in one of my rental properties and want it my own home. Simple you would think. But not for Vodafone. I simply wanted one that my business pays for and one I will pay for myself to keep the payments totally seperate. Vodafone cant manage to do this unless the first payment on the new account comes out the account that pays the existing direct debit. So it is a new Broadband account at a different property but somehow Vodafone cant seperate them until the are set up. The total call lasted 1 hour 10 minutes and I would suggest 45 minutes of that time I was on hold as everything had to be discussed with the supervisor. It is clearly the incompetent being led by the even more incompetent and despite all of this I have received a contract and installation date without finalising the payment details. They probably think they will simply take the money from the existing account and hope to get away with. I have a 14 day cooling off period from the day of activation and as they wasted my time I will allow the instalallation and the delivery of their equiptment and cancel at the end of the cooling off period.

"If you value your sanity, please save yourself the rage inducing experience of trying to get broadband with Vodafone.","If I could give 0 stars I would. Where do I start?I chose to go with Vodafone for broadband as me and my partner are both on their phone plans and have never had any issues plus we appreciated the customer discount. Well if only I knew then what I know now...I selected the broadband package I wanted and checked out, the activation date was about 3 weeks from the day I placed the order which in itself was annoying but I moved past it as it seemed like the best deal.About 2 days before our connection was due to go live we'd still not received our router so I got my partner to ring and ask what the delay was only for him to be told that our order was cancelled due to an internal issue at Vodafone. Bare in my mind, Vodafone DID NOT tell us this until we rang them, so if we didn't ring we would've just never been told? From there, they made us place the order again over the phone where they re-took our details (this is important) assuring us that the router would be delivered the next day and made live on our original connection date. The router did get delivered but that was just the start of the problems. Aside from the fact the router is the clunkiest massive eyesore I've ever seen, it was an absolute nightmare to set up with about 4 different booklets of instructions just to get the thing working. In the end, the port which came with the router was a ADSL modem which doesn't fit in the standard Wi-Fi port in most homes, so we had to go out and buy an adapter just to plug the thing in. Having lived 3 weeks with no Wi-Fi we were desperate for it to go live but low and behold when we connected the router it didn't work. The connection was NOT activated. So on the phone again we went to Vodafone, ""Why do we not have a connection?"" we ask, to then be told that... OUR ORDER GOT CANCELLED... AGAIN!Never mind that they cancelled our order and didn't tell us for a second time, the question on our lips was WHY did it get cancelled?! Oh that's right, it was because the order was placed with my partners title as 'Master' instead of 'Mr' and the system didn't accept it. But wait... if we recall back, the second order was placed over the phone, we weren't the ones typing the details in, the Vodafone employee was... so yet again we are left Wi-Fi less because of Vodafone's incompetence. At our absolute wits end with this situation and this company, we then proceeded to spend another half an hour on the phone with the advisor to be told that we will now have to wait a FURTHER 2 WEEKS, for them to activate our connection. If you value your sanity, please save yourself the rage inducing experience of trying to get broadband with Vodafone.","['If you time value your sanity, please save yourself the rage rush experience of trying to get broadband with Vodafone.']","['if i could give 0 stars i would. where do i start? i chose to go with vodafone for broadband as me and my partner are both on their feet now and have never had any issues plus we appreciated the customer discount. well if only i knew then what i know now... i selected the broadband package i wanted and checked out, the activation date was about 3 weeks from the day i placed the order which in itself was unavailable but i moved past it as it seemed like the best deal. about 2 days before our connection was due to go live we\'d still not received this router so i got my partner to ring and ask what the delay was only for him could be told that our order was cancelled due to an internal issue at vodafone. bare in my mind, vodafone did not tell us this because we rang them, so if we didn\'t ring we would\'ve just never been told? from there, they made us place the order again over the phone where they re - took our details ( this is important ) assuring us that the router might be delivered the next day and made live on our original connection date. the router did get delivered but that was just the start of the problems. aside from the fact the router is the clunkiest massive eyesore i\'ve ever seen, it was an absolute nightmare to set up with about 4 different booklets of instructions just to get the thing working. in the end, the port which came with the router was a adsl modem which doesn\'t fit in the standard wi - fi port in most homes, so we had to go out and buy an adapter just to plug the thing in. having lived 3 weeks with no wi - fi we were desperate for it to go live but low and behold when we connected the router it didn\'t work. its connection was not activated. so on the phone again we went to vodafone, "" why do we not have a connection?

"Spotty Wifi that cuts out regularly, terrible customer service team.","The wifi is pretty spotty and cuts out I'd say for 5-10 minutes a day sometimes twice a day (this is across 2 different houses in 2 completely different places) The contract came to an end on June the first. I contacted them and told them I did not want to renew my contract IE continue with the contract. Fast forward 3 months and I've noticed in my bank statement that they have charged me for the past 3 months even though I said I did not want to renew. Then when I contacted them they told me auto-renewal is different from canceling my broadband and I needed to submit a formal application for cancellation (I was never told this on the chatbot) and they will not renew me but that's different than canceling. I then spoke to 3 customer service agents who told me they'd be able to refund me retroactively and apply my notice period from the 15th of May so I'd still have to pay for June which is fine. I then get to the fourth person and they say that is impossible and they will charge me one last time in September.

Vodafone is the best ever mobile network provider,I have been with Vodafone most of my life and I am now 50. In 2007 I went from Vodafone pay as you go to a Vodafone monthly contract and I was on Vodafone pay as you go for many years before that. I absolutely love everything about Vodafone and I will always be loyal to Vodafone and stay with them for many more years to come. No other mobile network provider will ever come close to Vodafone. Even though my monthly contract is quite expensive but as far as I'm concerned it really is worth every penny. I have never ever had a problem with Vodafone. They have the best ever customer service and fantastic customer offers. There is still no 5g coverage yet though but that will never be a problem to me as I'm sure they are working hard to get full 5g coverage to everyone and I will always be patient and wait for however long it takes as I know they are working hard and that's all that matters. Every year when my contract goes up in price Vodafone kindly inform their customers that the yearly price increase is necessary and that we as customers are investing in Vodafone with our yearly price increase. That sounds absolutely perfect to me as I really am more than happy to invest in such a brilliant mobile network company. They are and always will be number one out of all the mobile network providers.,['Vodafone is the best ever mobile network provider'],"[""i have been with vodafone most of my life and i am now 50. in 2007 i went from vodafone pay as you go to a vodafone monthly contract and i was on vodafone pay as you go for many years during that. i absolutely love everything about vodafone and i will always be loyal to vodafone and stay with them for many more years to come. no other mobile network provider will ever come close to vodafone. so though my monthly contract looks quite expensive but as far as i'm concerned it really is worth every penny. charities have never ever had a problem with vodafone. they have the best ever customer service and fantastic customer offers. there is still no 5g coverage yet though but that will never be a problem to me as i'm sure they are working hard to get full 5g coverage to everyone and i will always be patient and wait for however long it takes while i know they are working hard and that's all that matters. every year when my contract goes up in price vodafone kindly tell their customers that the yearly product increase is necessary and that good as producers are investing in good with our yearly price increase. that sounds absolutely perfect to me as i really am more than happy to invest in such a brilliant mobile network company. they are and always will be number one out of all the mobile network providers.""]"

It's fine until something goes wrong,"It's fine until something goes wrong. Then the nightmare begins. I used to get 58 up and 18 down on my Vodafone landline broadband. I arranged a new contract with them and suddenly the speed was only about 52 with a minimum guaranteed of 49. Six weeks ago I noticed the speed had dropped to 42 down and 9 up. I got in touch through the ""chat"" option on the website. Be aware that whether you phone or ""chat"" you will end up to talking to someone overseas and you WILL be on the chat/phone for 50-to-60 minutes every time. While they fiddle about, disappear for minutes at a time and generally behave as if you have all the time in the world. During one call when I mentioned how long it was taking the cheeky staff member told me ""just get on with your work while I do it""! However I was at home hanging about on the phone. I'm actually losing track of how many times I've been in touch now. I think the total is about three-and-a-half hours on chat and phone (or is it four-and-a-half?). The latest being 50 minutes on the phone today. The latest practice is they want to send you a link to turn on the camera on your mobile phone so they can see your set up. They will have you crawling around on the floor trying to remove the cover of the phone socket while webcamming the whole thing. It's like something out of a Victoria Wood sketch 40 years ago. As if they're doing everything they can to humiliate you. No matter what happened during the previous chat/call they will have you starting from scratch every time. For example today, despite a BT Openreach engineer visiting just over a month ago, confirming the low speed with his device and Vodafone saying in an email there was a fault with the line, today I was once again on the floor trying to remove the cover and webcamming the socket, because they ""can't"" do anything without this procedure. After the BT engineer visited the speed dropped further to about 38 down and 8 up and nothing at all seemed to be done. Three days ago I tried ""chat"" again and asked about cancelling the service which I'm entitled to do without penalty after 30 days below the guaranteed minimum speed. Wrongly I was told if I did there would be a penalty fee of about ¬£85. In frustration I wrote and posted a letter. Almost immediately the broadband became unusable. The broadband connection disappearing completely every few minutes with no ip4 signal. It was almost as if someone had sabotaged my line after the call. After two days of that I tried ""chat"" again this morning. The neighbour across the road has a connection of 76 down and 19 up with Vodafone. Another on the same side of the street, also with Vodafone, has 37 down and 8 up, like me. There seems to be some sort of issue with the line on the street. But guess what? This morning they wanted me to webcam the phone socket again. So I'm 62 and crawling around on the floor behind the desk trying to show shots of the socket. I did manage to get the cover off at last. But of course it's all absolutely pointless bureacracy because BT Openreach confirmed over a month ago with their equipment plugged into the socket that the line speed was low and Vodafone itself said in an email there was a line problem. And the neighbour has a problem. But the people on chat and phone just ""can't"" do anything without doing the whole procedure again from scratch. So it was another 50 minutes wasted.And even then the conclusion was that we have to wait and see until tomorrow. Even though the line has been dropping out for two days and when it works the speed is well below the guaranteed minimum. Weirdly a month ago the low speed was reason to bring in BT Openreach. But now apparently it isn't. So I have another call to look forward to tomorrow. The connection has already cut out once since the call. What planet are these companies on where they think customers have hours of time to spend while these ""support"" people fiddle about doing the same thing over and over?Of course it is a choice for any business to run its support in this way and no accident... Is it all deliberate psychological ""punishment"" to deter customers from complaining?So this what you have to look forward to if things go wrong... If you read this Vodafone DO NOT ask me to contact you on social media. RESPONSE TO THE REPLY FROM VODAFONE:I gave in and contacted them on Facebook chat. They have just asked me to phone the usual broadband support number which will no doubt take me down the one hour ""let's just test everything again"" rabbit hole! I would like the government to start prosecuting companies like this that deliberately put customers through this psychological pain. When MPs return I will talk with my Member of Parliament about Vodafone's ""service"".  As quickly as possible?

Everything Wrong with an ISP in One‚Ä¶,"Everything Wrong with an ISP in One Package.I've already complained about Vodafone around 18 months ago, when it took more than 150 days to activate Broadband that was supposed to be live in 10 days. As is the case now, that was caused by general incompetency, outsourcing of their team and lack of communication.Our street's internet went down (we live on a rural street with only 14 houses on it) after an OpenReach update to the Green Cabinet. The entire street lost connection and we all reported to our respective Internet Service Providers (ISPs). All did their usual checks and then quickly escalated to OpenReach, who have been at the box daily for the last 7 days re-connecting houses one or two at a time. We're now the last ones still offline and Vodafone refuse to escalate to OpenReach.I reported this a week ago. I've had to do numerous calls and video calls with their team, each time making me video myself unplugging the master socket, plugging in a DSL Splitter (which I had to purchase myself for ¬£8!!!!!), turning off and on etc.Each time the same result. I have told them on every single contact point (c. 12 times now) that two senior OpenReach engineers working at the box can see the fault, and need them to escalate to OpenReach for a job number to resolve, just as every other ISP has. Vodafone's response is for after 5 days, to have the UK internal team call to say they can see (after several more plugging in and unplugging episodes) a fault in their system which doens't require OpenReach. This was Sunday. I was told to wait until Wednesday because although the fix should be instant, I have to wait 3 working days! Wednesday comes around and surprise surprise (not!) no internet. I've now spoken with another support agent (no longer the UK team) who has had me unplugging and re-plugging everything again, and now wants external photos of the house because apparently there's no fault with our equipment or line, but because the test results show the OpenReach line working, there's a fault somewhere on our line (despite Vodafone saying there isn't themselves!).I am absolutely beyond exhausted with this. Best of all the '4G Ultra Backup' which is supposed to 'seamlessly switch to 4G if the internet goes down' doesn't work - completely useless.I have given Vodafone 24 hours to find a remedy or I will force them to terminate my contract at the 18/24 month mark. Completely unacceptable. Shoddy, unprofessional and completely useless. Stay well clear if having an internet connection you can depend on without having to wait weeks everytime there's an issue is important to you.UPDATES:> Within 1 hour of posting this Vodafones Social team 'reached out' to offer me a direct way to speak to the team. I did this, and after a few hours I've been told the social media team can't help and I need to continue through the same rubbish support channels as before, so this is just a PR stunt to look responsive. If only Vodafone could fix faults as quickly! Queue the promised call never coming, and instead I've been back and forth with a colleague on web chat who initially said an engineer was booked, only to then say the fault was fixed, then to decide it would require a response tomorrow from someone else.

DO NOT take out any contracts with Vodafone!,"DO NOT take out any contracts with Vodafone! Without a shadow of a doubt, the worst collective customer experience I have ever received. Expect to pull your hair out with extreme frustration!I took out a 24 month contract for a 5G unlimited Gigacube. Over the last month, I started noticing significant issues with upload speed / drops in connection. I spent HOURS on the phone to Vodafone to try to identify the problem and went through all the hoops only to be told there wasn't anything they could do and that - even though several members of the technical team agreed that an average of 1Mbps upload speed was unacceptable, it was 'performing within the parameters i.e. 0.5Mbps and 50Mbps' as per my contract. I complained as well as showing concern about falling outside of the '14 day return policy' but was told not to worry by one of Vodafone's technical support team as 'normally they allow 30 days for returns and can make exceptions given my poor experience to date'. I did some further investigation and found that the speeds dramatically increased... if the Gigacube is placed outdoors. In short, this device DOES NOT work well indoors. I have also recently found out (through my own investigation) that the Gigacube has a strict NAT type and thus is NOT fit for purpose for certain times of gaming, contradictory of the very generic statements advertised on their website about how fantastic it is for gaming. It didn't help that half of the technical advisors I spoke to didn't have a clue about this and weren't able to provide adequate support.Following my investigations, I contacted Vodafone again to discuss cancelling my plan and was told I could not. I explained this isn't what the previous advisor had said and had to go through the painful process of having to repeat myself for the third or fourth time at this point. I was left under the impression that I was locked into a 24 month contract with a product that simply isn't good enough and this whole situation has had a dramatic impact on my mental health (I'm due to start a new job soon and will need good enough upload speeds for video calls). It was at this point that I disposed of the packing, thinking nothing of it (more on this later).I finally managed to speak with someone who spoke with their manager and had the call in question listened to. A few days later, I received a call back saying a manager had approved this and I could end my contract without having to pay an early cancellation fee, thus admitting they were at fault. I was busy at the time of calling and asked for a call back this week to discuss further - it was confirmed that this would not impact the offer of leaving the contract without having to a pay a fee. A call back was arranged for today.Prior to today's call, I spoke with Vodafone,0 explaining again that we don't currently have Fibre installed in our property but this may be coming sooner than we thought and that perhaps a monthly contract may be more appropriate. I was told by one of the advisors that I could speak to retention and very possibly something could be done to reduce the price, but only after my 24 month contract had been cancelled.Fast forward to today's call. We were working through the cancellation when I advised I no longer had the packaging. I have now been told that this means I can't cancel my contract and will remain locked in to a 24 month contract. Even after all of the above - all of the time wasted, repetition, hours of my time, finding inadequacies and faults in their product, I have now been told if I can't return the item in it's original packaging then nothing can be done. I am receiving a call back from a manager within 24 hours, but the advisor said the manager will tell me the same thing. Absolutely ludicrous! Even the advisor themselves sympathized and said they understood the frustration. With all the focus on fair treatment of customers of late, this is a complete and utter violation. Not only have Vodafone given me a product that doesn't work properly, they're not training their teams properly, their customer representatives aren't recording notes at an appropriate level and the customer is suffering!I will update once I hear back from a manager!",['DO NOT take out any contracts with Vodafone!'],"[""do not take out any contracts with vodafone! without a shadow of a shadow, the worst collective customer experience i have ever received. expect to pull your hair out with extreme frustration! i took out a 3 month contract for a 5g unlimited gigacube. over the entire month, i started noticing significant issues with upload speed / drops in connection. i spent hours on the phone to vodafone to try to identify the problem and went through all the hoops only to be told there wasn't anything they could do and that - even though several members of the technical team agreed that an average of 1mbps upload speed was unacceptable, it was'performing within the parameters i. e. 0. 5mbps and 50mbps'as per my contract. i complained as well as showing concern about falling outside of the'14 day return policy'but was told not to worry by one of vodafone's technical support team as'normally they allow 30 days for returns and can make exceptions given my poor experience to date '. i did some further investigation and found that the speeds dramatically increased... if the gigacube is placed outdoors. in short, this device does not work well indoors. i have also recently found out ( through my own investigation ) that the gigacube has a strict nat type and thus is not fit for users for certain times of gaming, contradictory of the very generic statements advertised on their website about which fantastic it is for gaming. it didn't help that half of the technical advisors i spoke to didn't have a clue about this and weren't able to provide adequate support. following my investigations, i contacted vodafone again to discuss cancelling my plan and was told i could not. i explained this isn't what their previous company had said and had to go through the painful process of having to repeat myself for the third or fourth time at this point. i was left under the impression that i was locked into a 24 month contract with a product that simply isn't good enough and this whole situation has had a dramatic impact on my mental health ( i'm due to start a new job soon and will need good enough upload power for video calls ). it was nearer this point that i disposed of the packing, thinking nothing of it ( more on this later ). i finally learned to speak with someone who spoke with their manager and had the call in question listened to. a few days later, i received a call back saying a manager had approved this and i could end my contract without having to pay an early cancellation fee, thus admitting they were at fault. i was busy at the time of calling and asked for a call back this week to discuss further - it was confirmed that this would not impact the offer of leaving the contract without having to a pay a fee. a call back was arranged for today. prior to today's call, i spoke with vodafone, 0 explaining again that we don't currently have fibre installed in our property but this may be coming sooner than we thought and that perhaps a monthly contract may be more appropriate. i was told by one of the advisors that i could speak to retention and very possibly something could be done to reduce the price, but only after my 24 month contract had been cancelled. fast forward to today's call. we were working through the cancellation when i advised i no longer had the packaging. i have now been told that this means i can't cancel my contract and will remain locked in to a 24 month contract. even after all of the above - all of the time wasted, repetition, hours of my time, finding inadequacies and faults in their product, i have now been told if i can't return the item in it's original packaging then nothing can be done. i am receiving a call back from a manager within 24 hours, but the advisor said the manager will tell me the same thing. absolutely ludicrous! even the advisor themselves sympathized and said they understood the frustration. with all the focus on fair treatment of customers of late, this is a complete and utter violation. not only have vodafone given me a product that doesn't work properly, they're not training their teams properly, their customer representatives aren't recording notes at an appropriate level and the customer is suffering! i will update once i hear back from a manager!""]"

Give Darren a promotion!,"I never usually write reviews but this time I felt it was needed and deserved...I have been with ee for the last 11 years but over the last year I have had issues with signal and general lagging from their service whilst paying a high monthly cost.I met Darren a few months ago before knowing he worked for Vodafone and he told me about how he had no issues with the service.

Lucky escape- AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"Engineer turned up to fit my broadband.. took one look outside and obviously decided the job wasn't for him.

Duped into a contract from PAYG,"Several years ago I purchased a Vodafone 'Pay as You Go' dongle. After having several months of difficulties topping it up, I entered a Vodafone shop and requested assistance in topping it up. I was advised to set up monthly payments via direct debit. I was assured that it was not a contract I was entering but an easier way of topping up. After disregarding my dongle several years ago I have received a debt collection agency letter stating I owed over ¬£250+ for a breach of contract despite me never intentionally entering into one. It appears Vodafone set up a contract for me despite me having a PAYG dongle. I have spent yesterday and all morning trying to resolve this issue but it appears I was duped by the shop worker into taking a contract without my agreement (I bought a PAYG and intended it to stay that way). Instead Vodafone insist I had a contract (which I did not) and I now have a debt collection agency pursuing me. Vodafone Customer service is appalling particularly when you have a valid grievance. I have left Vodafone and would advise never to touch them should you have a legitimate grievance.It appears from Vodafone's response that I go to their social media pages for resolution yet I have spent all morning speaking to many people/robots trying for them to accept I did not enter into a contract.

You couldn't make it up,"I applied to Vodafone to provide broadband services at a property I'd completed the purchase of the previous day. Despite having a perfect credit history and the highest possible credit rating with both my bank and the major credit referencing agencies, I failed Vodafone's credit check. I asked if it was because they'd credit checked me against the new property, where I wasn't yet registered as living and they refused to confirm. I appealed and sent them a copy of my Experian credit report. Their response was to infer that they could see information that credit reference agencies couldn't see. This alarmed me, as my professional work depends on my having an unimpeachable credit history, so I asked them to elaborate, which they refused to do. I then managed to establish, via a Subject Access Request, that they held no information about me that credit reference agencies couldn't see and, in fact, the reason for failing the credit check was because they had indeed checked me against the new property, where I wasn't yet registered as living. I made a complaint about their processes and at the end of the process, they concluded that the only person at their end who'd done anything wrong were the Subject Access team, who apparently should not have divulged the reason for the credit check fail. So, the team that I, as a customer, thought had done a brilliant job, the team that resolved all of my worries, is the team they're going to investigate for not following company policy.

What can I say,"What can I say, the reason I have stayed loyal to Vodafone for all these years is my local store manager Liam (stockton on tees) who always goes above and beyond to help me even with menial tasks like helping me with phone storage or logging back into my Vodafone app and always does so with a smile on hes face. Today was one of those days my phone screen decided to go off for no apparent reason, so I went down to the store and unfortunately for Liam I was a bit of a mess as I was panicking as I'm on the transplant list and need to have an open phone line for that very important phone call coming through. Liam knows my story and has always asked how I am and is always tentative with all customers I see, this is a massive positive I see in customer relations it just makes you feel valued.

Stay away from Vodafone and read my review as to why.,"Firstly I stupidly updated a contract with Vodafone after calling to get my code to transfer my numbers. Everything was great with the upgrade of the phone‚Äôs. Then it all started to go in a spiral downward direction. So I had the latest iPhone and realised my watch was 5 generations behind so I went online to upgrade and collect at a local store. Easy hey? No! After chasing my order as the updates weren‚Äôt happening I was told my watch would be ready to collect after 4pm. I went along just after 5pm to be greeted by a very helpful assistant who was training. He went to get his colleague from out back to assist me and came back and said he wouldn‚Äôt be long as he was using the toilet. No problem we all need natural breaks. After about 10 minutes a lady came in and said she wanted to take out a new contract, the same assistant said just a moment I‚Äôll go and get my colleague as he did with me. He went out back and his colleague appeared came to me asked me if I had the correct ID and I replied yes I did. He walked out to the back room and when he came back said It‚Äôs just arrived and to come back in 30 minutes as it needs to update on the system. I explained I had a doctors appointment to attend and wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it back before the store closed and then was told to come back tomorrow I explained I was going away the next day for two weeks and he just shrugged his shoulders and said well it will only be held for a week so the order will be cancelled. I‚Äôve never heard such rubbish and receive such bad customer service. He wanted the new contract rather than just hand a product over that he probably wouldn‚Äôt get commission for. After quite a few phone calls I was assured the order would be cancelled. The following day I went into a store in Cwmbran in Wales and had great service and got a watch. Then a week later my partner wanted a watch so I went online to order one and signed contract etc and had confirmation that it would be delivered on Friday. Received no more information so again went online to chat to them to be told that it had been rejected but never bothered to tell me. After a long telephone call I was told it had been cancelled as they had no stock of the watch. Couldn‚Äôt give me a reason as to why I was not notified. Trying to speak to anyone with this company is very difficult as it just keeps sending links to their website. To make this worse the watch for my partner was a 25th anniversary gift and I had to get up this morning and try to explain this. Yes it sounds like a made up story as an excuse but fortunately they know what the customer service with Vodafone is like and fortunately believed me. I‚Äôm still trying for the watch but guess what customer service can‚Äôt source one or check the system for a shop that has any in stock. I wish I experienced this before my 14 day opt out of contact but sadly I‚Äôm stuck with them for  3 years. I could type more but I hope you get the idea what awful service I received.",['Stay away from Vodafone and register my review as to why.'],"['firstly i stupidly updated a contract with vodafone after calling to get my code to transfer my numbers. everything was great with the upgrade of the phone ‚Äô s. then it all started to go in a spiral downward trend. so i contacted the latest iphone and realised my watch was 5 generations behind so i went online to upgrade and collect at a local store. easy feedback? no! after chasing my order where the updates weren ‚Äô t happening i was told my watch would be ready to collect after 4pm. i went along just after 5pm to be greeted by a very helpful assistant who was training. he went to get his colleague from out ahead to assist me and came back and said he wouldn ‚Äô t be long as he was using the toilet. no problem we all need natural breaks. after about 10 minutes a lady came in and said she wanted to take out a new contract, the same assistant said just a moment i ‚Äô ll go and get my colleague as he did with me. he went out back and his colleague appeared came to me asked me if i had the correct id and i replied yes i did. he walked out to the back room and when he came back said it ‚Äô s just arrived and to come back in 30 minutes as it needs to update on the system. i explained i had a doctors appointment to attend and wouldn ‚Äô t be able to make it back before the store closed and then was expecting to come back tomorrow i explained i was going away the next day for two weeks and he just shrugged his shoulders and said well it will only be held for a week so the order will be cancelled. i ‚Äô ve never heard such rubbish and receive such bad customer service. he wanted the new contract rather than just hand a product over that he probably wouldn ‚Äô t get commission for. after quite a few phone calls i was assured the order would be cancelled. the following day i went into a store in cwmbran in wales and had great service and got a watch. then a week later my partner wanted a watch so i went online to order one and signed contract etc and had confirmation that it would be delivered on friday. received no more information so again was online to chat to them to someone told otherwise it had been rejected but never bothered to tell me. after a long telephone call i was told it had been cancelled as they had no stock using the watch. couldn ‚Äô t give me a reason as to why i was not notified. trying to speak to anyone with this company is very difficult as it just keeps sending links to their website. to make this worse the watch for my partner was a 25th anniversary gift and i had to get up this morning and try to explain this. yes it sounds like a made up story as an excuse but fortunately they know what the customer service with vodafone is like and fortunately believed me. i ‚Äô m still trying for the watch but guess what customer service can ‚Äô t source one or check the system for a shop that has any in stock. i wish i experienced this before my 14 day opt out of contact but sadly i ‚Äô m stuck with them for 3 years. i could type more but i hope you get the idea what awful service i received.']"

I'm trying to come away from Vodaphone, my mobile phone contract is ending and I have tried to call and sort, but have been directed to the TOBI online chat. My experience with this the worse customer service experience that I have ever received. From explaining what I wanted and didn't want anything but the process to end my contract, The advisor ""jack"" tried to cross sell and upsell me everything (pay as you go, broadband, media packages) other than giving me my PAC code so I can leave Vodaphone's service. I had to ask him 4 times to stop trying to sell me something other than what I wanted and was very polite about it but it went on and on and the conversation went on and on, which is either a failing with the individual or Vodaphones retention policies. This then ended up with a ""red outage"" which I was told a system wide error and I would have to come back tomorrow. If the advisor had just cut out the up/cross selling when I had asked 5 minutes into the conversation I could have my PAC code and been on my way. Instead I was kept on for 45 minutes where in the outage happened at approx the 30 min mark. This is tantamount to not allowing me to change provider which is compensational by Ofcom. I was promised an option to download the chat, which I then also couldn't. This experience, along with the patchy service, ever increasing yearly prices and clunky app with 0 realistic achievable rewards have made sure I will never give Vodaphone my business ever again and if ever asked I will steer people away from at every opportunity.",['I would give zero stars If I could'],"['i would give 0 stars if i could. i\'m trying to come away from vodaphone, my mobile phone contract is ending and i have tried to call and sort, but have been treated to the tobi online chat. my experience with this the worse customer service experience that i ever actually received. from explaining what i wanted and didn\'t want anything but the process to end my contract, the advisor "" jack "" tried to cross sell and upsell me everything ( pay as you go, broadband, media packages ) other than giving me my pac code so i can leave vodaphone\'s service. i had to ask him 4 times to stop trying to sell me something other than what you wanted and was very polite about it but it went on and on and the conversation went on and on, which is either a failing with each individual or vodaphones retention policies. this then ended up with a "" red outage "" which i was told a system wide error and i would have to come back tomorrow. if the advisor had just cut out the up / cross selling when i had asked 5 seconds into the conversation i could have my pac code and been on my way. instead i was kept on for 45 minutes where in the outage happened at approx the 30 min mark. this is tantamount to not allowing me to change provider which is compensational by ofcom. sally was promised an option to download the chat, which right then also couldn\'t. this experience, operating alongside the patchy service, ever increasing yearly prices and clunky app with 0 realistic achievable rewards have made sure i will never give vodaphone my business ever again and if ever asked i will steer people away from at every opportunity.']"

Total Shambles (or is it)!!!,"Well, what a shambles. I have been with Vodafone for a number of years on their broadband packages. I will not be renewing next time!As part of the many emails I received from Vodafone I saw an upgrade was available to me. This was to upgrade from full fibre 500Mb to full fibre 910Mb, for just ¬£2 per month. Beware, this sounds great, however there are some big downfalls with this.I was told that my existing equipment would be all good to take the new speeds.I got the upgrade within 3 days and had speeds in to the house of around 960Mb.So all good?No! The WiFi was still at exactly the same speed as when I was on the 500Mb package.I got in touch with the online chat to see what was going on and finally got through to a person to talk to.From this conversation I was told that because the speed in to the house was correct all was fine and there was nothing to do, unless I upgraded to a higher package with an additional ¬£12 per month over my existing 500Mb package.Does this seem like a hook to get people to upgrade and then hit them with a bigger monthly payment? I think so.I was told the newer equipment with boosters would increase the WiFi, as I had a lot of devices on the WiFi.I tested this by removing the majority of devices off the WiFi, running a speed test. This made no difference at all. All I could assume from this was the equipment I had, and was told would be fine, was not up to the job.To be clear I was not expecting the full speed through WiFi, however I would have expected a marked increase, especially as I performed the tests whilst directly by the side of the router.I advised that I wanted to come out of the cooling off period, reverting back to my previous contract. This I was told would be done.I asked that I receive confirmation that my previous contract was back in force, with the same price and end date. I was told that Vodafone could not send emails, only text messages. Maybe Vodafone need an upgrade to their systems to allow this? Anyway I received a text to confirm this, and I was told to ignore any other information thatI had emailed, as this was automatically generated.All went back to the previous speeds, and I thought that was an end to it. Unfortunately not!I received a bill today which is in line with the 910Mb plan. Checking my online account I saw that not only had I been charged for a full month at the higher rate, my old package had also gone up in price. Why?I spent over an hour on an on line chat with Vodafone, where the advisor told me I had additional documentation and this was the price of the new contract. I informed the advisor of the previous communications. All they could offer is that I call the office. It took three attempts to get through, as two of the numbers they gave me were not valid. What a waste of time this chat was! They could not even discuss this within the organisation and transfer me (where is the customer service).I finally got to talk to an advisor and I then had to go through the whole story again. After much conversation I am now at the old payments. I have asked for confirmation that the old contract is still in place. Again this can not be done via an email, due to Vodafone's policies, so all the advisor could send is a text, however as they have an outage this could not be sent, so I still have no guaranty that all is as it should be.I have emphasised throughout my conversations that I need confirmation on my contract and that an email confirming all current information should be sent, however Vodafone have no intention of doing this, which I think is very poor and stinks of trying to pull a fast one on its customers.Very poor and disappointing.",['Total Shuffling (or is it )! !!'],"[""well, what a shambles. i have been with vodafone for a number of years on their broadband packages. i will not be renewing next time! as part of the many emails i received from vodafone i saw an upgrade was available to me. this was to upgrade from full usb 500mb to full fibre 850, for just ¬£2 per month. beware, this sounds great, however there are some big downfalls with this. i was told that my existing equipment would be all good so take the new speeds. i got the upgrade within 3 days and had speeds in to the house of around 960mb. so all good? no! the wifi was still at exactly the same speed as when i was on the 500mb package. i got in touch with the online chat to see what was going on and finally got through to a person to talk to. from this conversation i was told that because the speed in to the house was correct all was fine and there was nothing to do, unless i upgraded to a redesigned package with an additional ¬£12 per month over my existing 500mb package. does this seem like a hook to get people to upgrade and then hit them with a bigger monthly payment? i think so. i was told the newer equipment with speed would increase the wifi, as i had a lot of devices on the wifi. i tested properly by removing the majority of devices off the wifi, running a speed test. this made no difference at all. all i could assume from this was the equipment i had, and was told would be fine, was not up to the job. to be clear i was not expecting the full speed through wifi, however i would have expected a marked increase, especially as i performed the tests whilst directly by the side of the router. i advised that i wanted to come out of the cooling off period, reverting back to the previous contract. this i was told would have done. i asked that i receive confirmation that my previous contract was back in force, with the same price and end date. i was told that vodafone could not send emails, only text messages. maybe vodafone need an upgrade to their systems to allow this? anyway i punched a text to confirm this, and i was told to ignore any other information thati had emailed, as data was automatically generated. all went back to the previous speeds, and i thought that was an end to it. unfortunately not! i received a bill today which is in line with the 910mb plan. checking my online account i saw that not only had i been charged for a full month at the higher rate, my old package had also gone up in price. why? i spent over an hour on an on line chat with vodafone, where the advisor told me i had additional documentation and this was the price of the new contract. i informed the advisor of the previous communications. all they could offer is that i call the office. it took three attempts to get through, as two of the numbers they gave me were not valid. what a waste of time this chat was! they could not even discuss this within the organisation and transfer me ( where is the customer service ). i finally got to talk to an advisor and i then had to go through the whole story again. after much conversation i am now at the old payments. i have asked for confirmation that the old contract is still in place. again this can not be done via an email, due to vodafone's policies, so all the advisor could send is a text, however as they have an outage this could not be sent, so i still have no guaranty that all is as it should be. i have emphasised throughout my conversations that i need confirmation on my contract and that an email confirming all current information should be sent, however vodafone have no intention of doing this, which i think is very poor and stinks of trying to pull a fast one on its customers. very poor and disappointing.""]"

"Clear advice, friendly and helpful staff, definitely recommend an in-store visit","We came in looking for new phones on Vodafone after having the current ones for 6 years. I‚Äôd tried to upgrade myself on the app and via the online chat but didn‚Äôt find this helpful. The advisor didn‚Äôt give much information or options. So we decided to go into a store and I‚Äôm so glad we did! The store assistant (Tom) listened to what we were looking for, provided options and recommended what would be best for us personally. We were getting three new phones and SIM deals which took quite a while to set up but nothing was too much. Rather than us waiting, Tom got his colleague Daria to help too.

5 stars for Jasmin & Luke,"I went into the store after being told that it would take 3-5 days for the tech team to get back to me. I could see that the store was understaffed, I had to wait around 30 minutes which ended up being worth the wait.

Nightmare! Where do I start,"Vodafone: A Total Nightmare - Stay Far, Far Away! Where do I even begin with this disaster? On the 6th of August, I made the colossal mistake of joining Vodafone, and it has been nothing short of a complete and utter nightmare ever since. The phone arrived, but guess what? The number wasn‚Äôt even activated. By Friday, the 9th, I provided the PAC code to transfer my old number over, and Vodafone assured me the transfer would be completed by 3pm on Monday. Well, 4pm rolls around on Monday and still no signal. Funny enough, my old network provider disconnected my phone, leaving me completely stranded. So, I contacted Vodafone to get some answers. What did they do? Blame my old provider for disconnecting my service too early! They even had the audacity to tell me to contact my old provider to sort it out. When I did, my old provider explained that the reason for the disconnection was because Vodafone had already activated the PAC code. This means my number should have been active and working! Back to Vodafone I go, using my work mobile because‚Äîthanks to Vodafone‚ÄîI‚Äôm left without a phone now. And, as you might expect, Vodafone blamed my old provider again, claiming there was an issue with the transfer file and assured me it would be completed by midnight. Tuesday morning, 9am‚Äîstill no activation. Cue another excruciatingly long call to Vodafone. Not to mention the obstacle course of pressing 100 buttons just to reach an advisor who was unprofessional, calling me ""darling"" and asking ""are you with me?"" when clearly they had no clue what was going on. Another hour wasted on the phone and I‚Äôm told there‚Äôs yet another error in the transfer, and guess what? It will take another 48 hours to complete! I asked to speak to a manager, only to encounter someone who was unhelpful, uninterested, and unwilling to assist. When I requested information on how to file a complaint, the call was disconnected! Moments later, I received an email informing me a complaint had been filed on my behalf‚Äîwithout even disclosing what was said in the complaint! Then there‚Äôs Adele from the complaint department. She emailed saying she would call between 2 and 4pm without even checking if I was available. I wasn‚Äôt. She called again after 5pm, and honestly, she might as well have been a robot. All I heard was, ‚ÄúAt the current moment, we are working to resolve the issue,‚Äù repeated like a broken record. It‚Äôs now Wednesday, a full six days after providing the PAC code, and still NOTHING. I have no phone to use, my old number is in limbo, and my Vodafone number has never worked. I‚Äôm about to go on holiday abroad on Friday, a fact I‚Äôve mentioned to them multiple times. I‚Äôm also undergoing medical treatment and need to be reachable by the hospital‚Äîbut Vodafone apparently thinks it‚Äôs acceptable to leave me stranded like this. Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget‚Äîthey‚Äôve already sent an email saying they‚Äôre going to charge me one month upfront for their non-existent services! No, thank you, Vodafone.

I was served by Taz, and although I had no idea what phone I wanted he made the whole process simple and easy, was able to keep to my budget and left with a phone that day.He also called through to their cancellation team for me for a separate contract. I did not mention this but going on calls is something I find incredibly hard to do due to mental health but felt very calm with his help.He layed all information out clearly about payments/charges etc... very professional and a joy to talk to.","[""Came in today to grease one's palms a new phone""]","['came along today to buy a fixed phone / receiver and to cancel an existing contract. i was served by taz, and although i had no idea what phone i wanted he saw the whole process simple and easy, was able eventually keep to the budget and left with a phone that lasted. he also called through to their cancellation team for me accepting a separate contract. i did not mention this but going on calls is something i find incredibly hard to do due to diabetes health but felt very calm with his help. he made all information out clearly about payments / charges etc... very professional and a joy to talk to.']"
Vodaphone sim only,"I recently tried to get a business contract, which didn‚Äôt start off well with the web site not working and having to call up to arrange. The lady I spoke to was very friendly and a credit to your company however that‚Äôs where the praise stops. After passing all credit checks I was asked to send over my ID and proof which I understand, however I was also asked for a hand written letter with my request. Why hand written not really modern, and don‚Äôt really understand what it proves that a business email can‚Äôt. I was also asked for a questionnaire which had to be filled out as part of my credit, mmmmmm really. The questionnaire was basically just an invitation for all cold calls no thanks.
