Appalling customer service,"I switched to Vodafone broadband/home phone in March 2024. The switch went smoothly, speeds were as expected, and the connection has been stable. Digital voice has also worked OK apart from once where the phone stopped ringing. A router reset fixed the problem. So why the low rating? Vodafone customer service is absolutely appalling. If you try the online chat route you first have to deal with AI TOBi. It's utterly useless. Typing ""I want to speak with a human"" does get the result you want although, frankly, you may be forgiven for thinking that some of the humans are actually AI. Every issue I've raised has taken at least 3/4 hour of a painfully slow exchange where you are left waiting with the instruction to type a full stop every few minutes so that the chat doesn't disconnect. And just because the customer service representative says the problem is sorted it doesn't mean it is. This time I tried the telephone option. I'm 27 minutes into the call and not convinced the person I'm holding for has a clue. All Vodafone customer service is based abroad and the strong accents make it difficult to understand at times. I've ended the call after 38 minutes as, despite me having it in black and white that a refund would be given for the add-on that I cancelled, the agent is unable to do it. I've been offered a gesture of goodwill that doesn't cover the money I am owed. I will now resort to a physical letter."
Emily was extremely helpful,Emily was extremely helpful in getting me a new phone and gave me an excellent deal to add an iPad to my contract too
"Services not delivered, cancellation not confirmed","It worked well until I moved houses and wanted to bring my broadband connection at the new place. After 2 months of waiting and speaking to 4 different people, I was still on the waiting list for getting the broadband installed at the new place. I found myself under a new order/contract still under the previous address details and with no idea when the new order would be executed. Today I have asked for a cancellation of the contract, on the basis that services were not delivered for months and probably not going to be delivered in the foreseeable future. I have been told that they cancelled the service, but that they cannot confirm in writing that the contract has been cancelled. Very poor customer experience in my case."

Awful thieves steer clear,"My phone bill is ¬£8 monthly. For the last three months I've been having to buy additional data which has taken my bill up significantly. For example this month my bill will be circa ¬£100 according to the app. I couldn't work out how every time I bought extra data it ran down as if I didn't so having been buying more. Today I watched the before and after on the app. Each time I bought more data they wiped the remaining data off. So today I had 1.1gb I had paid circa ¬£8 for bought 2bg more and they removed my 1.1gb!!!! I was told it's not transferable so you lose it. Fair enough but my next bill is not for weeks so they've been removing my data before they add the new one. Meaning I haven't been using what I've paid for. Submitted a formal complaint and requested a response in writing and of course they called instead so not to leave a paper trail. Just ridiculous. Then had to accept a lesser amount than I'd lost (even by their calculations) because they don't want to return the full amount so rounded down! Ridiculous, how about I round down before paying the next bill? Bet that wouldn't be acceptable. My contract is up in a few months & I will be taking my custom elsewhere."

Update on my experience on 11th‚Ä¶,"Update on my experience on 11th September.  I was so disappointed in the lack of interest in my not receiving calls/no network inside my house, I called again to make a complaint.  I was put through to a gentleman called Abdul.  He listened, spoke with a manager and asked that I hold on while tests were being run.  He said if the call was terminated, he would call back.  It was, and he did.  He asked me to turn off my internet and try to make calls from different areas in my house and he would call back in 1 hour to see how I got on.  I cannot believe it worked.  Every room I made a call to my landline and I had no problems.  I started again, this time with my internet on, and after a little blip in one area of the house, the rest worked.  Abdul called back and advised he would call again on the 12th to check everything was still ok.  Really pleased it worked, so if anyone has a problem, maybe just go straight to complaints.  Everything is still ok, but he never called back on 12th.  If he had it would have been a 5 star review."

I'm Confused,"This is a note to my fellow customers in the hope that you do not have to experience what I have.¬† Please let me explain.I bought an internet broadband package from Vodafone on the 20th of March 2024.¬† What tempted me to this package was that I would get a ¬£75.00 Amazon gift voucher after 3 months.

It‚Äôs such a shame that Vodafone is very happy to take my money every month, but when it‚Äôs time to stand and deliver, I am referred to a third party that in my opinion does not exist.With all the above in mind, I will wait until the end of the month and if I have not received my ¬£75.00 Amazon gift voucher as promised, I will close my account and go to another provider.¬† ¬†It's all been very disappointing."

Unbelievably bad service,"Unbelievable how Vodafone keeps messing up things and is not able to fix it. I phoned the customer service a few weeks ago to find out if I could upgrade to a better contract. A lady talked me through options and it sounded good, but then in the end she mentioned that I was getting a new SIM card and phone number (!), which I definitely didn't want (who would?). BTW: what a detail to forget mentioning in first place! So I said I didn't want to go ahead with this and told her to stop the process and thought that was that. But still on the same phone call she already had set the whole bandwagon in motion, and said she couldn't stop it anymore. I said she needed to cancel it, but for some reason she couldn't and asked me to call back next day. Long story short, I chased Vodafone customer service for several consecutive days, hours on the phone to get this contract cancelled which I didn't sign up to in first place. In addition they messed about with my existing plan and I lost a few quid over that, since I suddenly was charged for text messages, as I found myself outside the plan. Again, customer service said they could not do anything about it and one of them got really rude with me, and telling me I didn't understand that this is how Vodafone works. In the meantime I got several emails from Vodafone confirming stuff that had nothing to do with me or my account, and a message that they had send the SIMcard for the contract I never ordered to - tadaaaa - a wrong address. (you cannot make this up, right?...)After ca 5 days of this I finally got the confirmation that mentioned contract was cancelled and everything back to what it as before this mess (except me being a few quid out of pocket, and several hours of my life lost). The week after, I get another email welcoming me to my new account. So I called again and went trough the endless automated bla bla before you get to a human, just to confirm once more I never signed up for this contract. I thought that was the end of it. Guess what: it wasn't. Today I got an email confirming that my account was cancelled and that I had to settle the final bill of 13.50. Seriously? I mean, seriously? The fun part: even if I wanted to pay (which I am obviously not going to do), they said I needed to call them (I guess it is because they don't have an authorised debit on this order, because I never wanted to order!) So I am now braving myself to face another phone call with them, or two, or three..."

Who knew a broadband install could be so painful and dragged out?,"Where to start? Bought my first house - stressful enough. Arranged a go live date for once I was in and before I went back to work (27/08). On the day, the engineers from Cityfibre arrived, did the install inside the house and proceeded outside. They were here for a while before telling me that there was an issue with the cable channels outside - but as it was early in the day, someone else would be out on the same day to solve the issue. Of course, no one materialised. I eventually managed to get through on the online chat, where my ‚Äúsame day fix‚Äù turned into 5-10 working days, *at least*. The next engineer visit was then scheduled for 09/09, but I didn‚Äôt need to be in the house when they did it.09/09 rolls around and I get a call from the engineers asking permission to dig up my garden to sort the issue. I agreed, as long as everything was put back afterwards. I came home excited to finally not have to pay for additional data on my phone, but still, I was not connected. Oh, and also came back to splatters of mud across my front door and the house itself, which was nice. Another (slow) trawl through online ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù determined that once again, Cityfibre were somehow unable to fix the issue. So, they could call to ask to dig up my garden, but *not* to inform me they couldn‚Äôt do the work?! The agent told me it would be 2 working days before I would get an update with yet another engineer appointment.Today (12/09) I contacted them as I still had not heard anything, only to be told that Cityfibre actually have until 17/09 to respond to the request with a solution. The agent was very unsympathetic and didn‚Äôt seem to care at all. Basically told me it was tough - whichever broadband provider I went to, that I would still be serviced by Cityfibre. Agent had no interest in speeding things up for me or investigating the issue further.Look, I understand the need to outsource some work. But how are a company as big as Vodafone relying on a company as shoddy, inconsistent and uncommunicative as Cityfibre? To add insult to injury, I cannot log on to my Vodafone account to cancel the contract and go elsewhere, as they don‚Äôt give you the ability to log into your account until their service has gone live and they have taken your money.Overall this has been a dismal experience that has cost me time and money (and is still not resolved). This has affected my work, and will continue to do so until it is resolved. Wish I had gone elsewhere - might have at least had some consistent communication about what on earth the issue is."

Really poor service from Vodafone,"Really poor service from Vodafone, I have been with them for years and recently decided to purchase my partners phone through them as well, what a mistake this was. It got sent to the wrong store, then when it reached the right store we were not notified so we didn't collect it on time. So they emailed us to say 'its been cancelled you will be refunded' a week and a half later no refund so I contacted them to be told, oh sorry I can see there was an issue with the refund going through, I will get the team to push it through now. We are now a week on from this and this morning I received a text message to say 'call us on this number for your refund' so I did, after taking 30 minutes to get through the person they then said they would send me a link for me to enter all of my card details for a refund. Suspicious of this I declined and logged back onto the chat to check that this was real, meanwhile having a search on google which quickly showed me that companies shouldn't have to ask for card details to process a refund for a payment that was taken online, I can further back this up that I provide refunds for online orders at my job and we never have to ask for card details unless the refund is more than 6 months old. The person on the chat confirmed they did in fact need me to fill in all of my card details so I asked if they could send me the link since I had been through all of the security with them too, the answer was no so I now need to spend another 30 minutes on hold to get the link to give away all of my card details, and who knows if I will receive the refund at all.. Ive spent about ¬£200 worth of time trying to chase this up and get the refund back and i feel like i'd have been better forgetting about it and going to work instead.. i'd have got my ¬£200 faster!!"

After calling the so called customer service, we were told that we failed their checks with zero explanation why. What's worse is we had no communication about this, only confirmation of the installation day. We are spending our money at Virgin and will not recommend Vodaphone to anyone."

Make it impossible to cancel,"Came back after a year out of the country to find out I'd been put on a 'rolling contract' that's ridiculously expensive and I've been over paying since my old contract ran out in 2023. Ask to move onto a new SIM with the same company and get told it's 30 days, so will have to pay another month's worth (on top of the new pay as you go SIM price) to even get rid of it!! In store a guy transferred my number onto a new SIM (same 'contract') and it was done in 24 hours, so where this suspect 30 days comes from is ridiculous (and likely a money making move from Vodafone, rather than a nice for the customer one). I don't see how this is legal for companies to do in this day and age, so I wouldn't recommend Vodafone as they'll try to con you out of every penny. Not to mention they tried to sell me the worst SIM they have over webchat rather than actually being helpful and providing reasonable ones (i.e. the pay as you go plus bundle). Which just made me more annoyed.Really disappointed in the way they do this and would now not recommend. Especially to unsuspecting people where English isn't first language or you're not tech savvy.Most frustrating experience."

Avoid Vodafone like the plague if you want good customer service!!!!!,"Another absolutely awful customer experience from Vodafone. Had a threatening email about a missed payment. Contacted them and it was for my Apple Watch. I‚Äôd just cancelled my phone with them after being a loyal customer for 20 years after more horrendous customer service. They sent my final bill and wiped my app clean of all devices including my watch. Then didn‚Äôt take the direct debit and tried to blame me for cancelling my airtime plan in my phone, which caused the watch direct debit to cancel. But hasn‚Äôt cancelled at my end so direct debit was still active. But still they won‚Äôt admit to there mistakes. Now all 4 of my family have cancelled thier Vodafone contracts and we‚Äôve gone to EE. They can‚Äôt do enough! Don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs changed in Vodafone in the last 12 months, but their customer service is awful and I‚Äôd avoid like the plague. Bet they don‚Äôt even acknowledge this review."

"Fast,efficient and friendly","Had issues with my phone being unable to make and receive calls although WhatsApp calls were working. I had tried all recommended resets without success.Ryan in the Vodafone shop attended to me as soon as I walked in, asked a few questions and stated the most likely issue(SIM card). Within 10 minutes he had sorted the problem and checked that phone was working correctly.He gave me information on upgrades when I asked ,but wasn‚Äôt pushy. He was friendly, efficient and knowledgeable.Brilliant service from Vodafone!"
Genuinely pathetic,Genuinely pathetic. Internet routinely drops out late at night for no reason. Avoid this terrible company.
The most apaulling service ever,"The most apaulling service ever. I was offered an upgrade on my phone which I accepted. Being an older customer and not very good when it comes to phones, I went to the Vodaphone shop in Portsmouth and asked if they could be kind enough to swap over all the data from the old phone to the new one. I was told I would have to pay ¬£25 for this service. I am a pensioner and was shocked as other phone providers do not charge. I paid and about 1 1/2 hours later was told the phone was now working so I left and came home. Once home however, I discovered that my phone was not working. I couldn't call out or receive calls or text. The next day I went to the Vodaphone Havant store as it was closer to my home. I explained the situation and was told quite bluntly that I would have to pay another ¬£25 for them to sort out what the other store had done, all in all costing me ¬£50! The manager was the scruffiest I have ever seen. Baggy old pants and long unkept hair down to his shoulders and an attitude to match. They then demanded to see my receipt which I had not brought with me but I showed them on my account the payment and date etc which they said was not proof! I asked them to phone Havant but they refused. Finally one of them looked and said the sim card had not been put in. He put it in and said everything was working and I left. I arrived home and once again no outgoing or incoming calls and no texts. I was most distressed as I am also diabetic and wear a Libra which is connected to the phone which sends out a warning if my glucose level drops preventing me from going into diabetic shock. It wasn't working! It is impossible to contact Vodaphone direct as you can't reach Vodaphone to complain as OneCom are their agents. I spoke to the OneCom girl who was very nice and said she would send me a new sim card. Today my plumber popped in to service my boiler and I was telling him. He asked if he could look at it. Within a couple if minutes he had it working perfectly. Someone had put the old sim card into the new phone! All this stress could have been avoided and I am horrified that they wanted me to pay ¬£50! I will most definitely not be renewing my contract. It's not worth the agro it has caused and the attitude of the Havant manager was apaulling."
Very poor. Got it very wrong,"Called in on Sunday to get a sim replacement for my phone the day my father died. I asked to please get it right as I need to call family and I was told the sim would work 2 hours later! It didn‚Äôt work, the shop never registered it so it was a complete disaster! I couldn‚Äôt even do it online because the new sim wasn‚Äôt registered by the shop staff"

I would select 0 starts if it was an‚Ä¶,"I would select 0 starts if it was an option. I have had trouble with Vodafone since Jan 2023. I cancelled my contract then, and I‚Äôm not sure whether somebody didn‚Äôt cancel it properly or if somebody from Vodafone opened the account back up (without my knowledge or consent). I‚Äôve been given different excuses each time I call. I have spent over ten hours on the phone to Vodafone to try and sort this, ending each phone call with a Vodafone employee promising me a refund and telling me they had sorted the problem. I have been given two missed payments on the last six months and it has destroyed my credit score, which had resulted in me being refused a mortgage. I went into the Vodafone shop in Ashford, where the assistant manager was helpful and wrote a complaint form for me. The team were then meant to get in contact with me and I‚Äôve yet again heard nothing. I have no idea what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt care about the money I‚Äôm owed, I just want my account cancelled and the missed payments off my account, as they were down to Vodafone‚Äôs mistakes. I would strongly advise anyone thinking of using Vodafone‚Äôs services to avoid them!You never know, someone might actually help me after this review .. Name: Alice Towndrow"

Steven - the legend!,"I had an incredible experience at the Redhill Vodafone branch on Sunday, all thanks to the exemplary service provided by the manager, Steven. From the moment he opened the doors, it was clear that he was committed to helping his customers.Over the weekend, my phone was stolen, leaving me feeling vulnerable and shocked. I encountered an elderly lady in a similar predicament, who was clearly in distress. She had become trapped in a frustrating cycle while attempting to contact Vodafone customer service from within the store. Steven quickly noticed her plight and sprang into action. He went above and beyond his job responsibilities to override a specific process, ensuring that both of us receive the assistance we required. Steven dedicated an impressive 2 1/2 hours to assist us. His patience, calm demeanour, and willingness to go the extra mile were truly remarkable. Thanks to his efforts, my business was able to continue smoothly, and I avoided what could have been a very challenging week. I cannot thank Steven enough for his incredible support and dedication. He exemplifies what customer service should be, and Vodafone is fortunate to have such an outstanding manager.Thank you, Steven, for being so amazing!"

I reached out to the customer service team again (!!) and looked for a solution and they told me that there should be something wrong with uswitch.com.  Then the customer service team tried to submit my application directly and said this should be alright.Finally, today, 11-Sept, I see that my third attempt was cancelled again.  I reached out to their customer service team but they never responded to my question this time in the chat.So disappointing with this company and it's frustrating to try something like this.

This is an additional ¬£50 over a 24 month contract.To make matters worse, When I challenged Lukas on online chat on the above, he stopped responding all together. I just tried calling the sales line, and after 10 minutes of waiting, the line disconnected. Vodafone always seemed to be a premium brand.

"I would give 0 stars if I could, I wonder if they know what 24hrs means.","Do not trust this company! I haven‚Äôt received signal to my phone in just under 2 weeks.

Then I try to access my account only to find my phone number isn‚Äôt attached to it, so speak via a web chat, I‚Äôm told that it will definitely be fixed in 24-48hrs. You guessed right still no signal, I then phoned customer service who put an order through with their ‚Äúbackend‚Äù and yes that would take 24hrs. Still nothing yet again, this time I find out that all previous orders had been cancelled before their 24hrs were up without informing me and this new one would do the job. Only thing is that I‚Äôd have to wait yet another 24hrs, I complained, they offered me a ¬£40 e-gift card for Vodafone (useless). I spoke to a manager who told me that she would keep a close eye on the issue and offered to pay Part but not all my next bill equalling less than the initial ¬£40 offered. However I‚Äôd have to wait 24hrs again. This time still no signal, I was told that my new sim must be broken too. I had enough and cancelled, I paid off my phone, that went through very easily, however cancelling the account did not. I was on hold for 30mins in total before they came back and said they‚Äôd phone back to confirm the cancellation after 24hrs. I asked if they could just email me that confirmation but no Vodafone cannot email! If they actually cancel my account I‚Äôll be glad to be rid of them. Crooks that is all they seem to be."

Do not use - worst broadband experience.. and ongoing,"WiFi signal doesn't reach the whole house. Constant connection issues that never resolved.

They won't let us out of contract early without penalties because the 'broadband is fine' - it's the router, booster and the house that are the problem. Worst decision ever was to switch. Paying more than we were through Sky for full fibre (we thought it would be a helpful upgrade and worth the extra cost) and it's even less reliable! As soon as our contract is up it will be cancelled and we will never use Vodafone for anything in the future.

To then be told that it can't be an upgrade and I would need to prove the notification/advert said upgrade to be given a refund or cancellation.

Wow right? no..Under closer inspection it‚Äôs through a company which essentially encourages people to pay monthly to them (gamble monthly) to win tickets which can then be used to make entries into prize draws. Websites like these can effectively suck people in to a world of addiction.It‚Äôs not very ethical to promote a company like this. Especially as prize draw companies are completely unregulated and controversial. You only need to read the negative (real) trust pilot reviews of this company to see why this is not just simply entering a competition. Real people. With real facing problems. How many Vodafone customers will go on to have similar problems?Vodafone should have no reason to cheapen themselves by choosing to align themselves with such a poor organisation and it‚Äôs now made me highly suspicious of any future promotions from Vodafone.Be careful who you align yourselves with.Shame on you!"

Scammed on upgrade,"I got their 500mb broadband package and i was content with everything, I got no problem with speed getting always 500+mb for just ¬£32.    The problem started when they offered me for an update saying ¬£35 for 910mb. Since I like playing online and just for few more Pounds I grabbed the upgrade expecting to get at least a more higher connection, but to my dismay that didn‚Äôt happen. Tried to contact their technical team gave me their solutions but still couldn‚Äôt increase the speed of my internet. So since Im getting the same speed just like the old package, I was furious and wanted to cancel the upgrades since there was no upgrade on my part but vodafone refused to. Vodafone said it is now 14 days past, and they are reiterating their argument that I am getting their promised MINIMUM speed, and can‚Äôt do anything about it. I felt I had been scammed by Vodafone, they are offering an upgrade luring people with their 910mb upgrade but will only provide the minimum speed and charge you higher, and they don‚Äôt want to send an engineer to fix the issue, they just do their online checks and said since i got the minimum speed there is no problem. What a scam."

Absolutely outraged!,Absolutely outraged!! Been a Vodafone customer for years and recently upgraded my broadband and phone which now neither work! Phone has been getting no data and tried to contact them they could not fix it and have to send me a new SIM card meaning I cannot access internet on my phone. The new broadband came without the correct adapter to attach my phone line for my business so I've been without a phone line to my cafe for two days. I've spent half a day on the phone. The WiFi is not connecting to our point of sale and the phone line is not working. I've lost business through their errors and half a day of pointless phone calls with no resolution. Avoid this company. I am completely disgusted!!

In 2 years time (after my contract) I will be back."

Great service,As usual the Vodafone staff were very helpful. Today KERRY was our assistant and she went the extra mile. Nothing was too much trouble. We left having had our problem sorted and paying less for a better service.
I am deeply disappointed with Vodafone,"I am deeply disappointed with Vodafone‚Äôs handling of my situation, and I would give them the lowest possible rating due to their complete lack of customer care and flexibility. My family member, the account holder, was involved in a serious accident and is currently in a hospital. Despite this, Vodafone refused to make any accommodations to reschedule the broadband installation or allow me to leave contact information for another person who could be on-site to assist the technician.I explained the gravity of the situation multiple times across several conversations with Vodafone‚Äôs support team, yet their rigid adherence to protocol prevented any real solution. They insisted on speaking directly with the account holder, despite the fact that he is physically unable to do so. This lack of empathy and unwillingness to adapt to unexpected circumstances is unacceptable.Now, as a result of Vodafone‚Äôs failure to accommodate, the technician will arrive and find no one at the property, wasting both time and resources. This situation could have easily been avoided with a simple note left for the installer or by accepting a contact number for another person, but Vodafone‚Äôs refusal to act humanely in this matter is deeply frustrating. Additionally, the responses from Vodafone‚Äôs customer support agents seem semi-automated.Their inability to offer even the slightest assistance in an urgent situation demonstrates a total disregard for their customers‚Äô needs. I strongly advise others to reconsider before choosing Vodafone, as their rigid processes and lack of customer support have caused unnecessary stress during an already difficult¬†time."
Wouldn't use again,"I have always used EE and decided to move to vodaphone. Huge mistake!I currently have a contract with them and the sim card hasn't worked since they blacklisted it back in June! This has been removed and had multiple attempts of rectifying this with vodaphone but still no luck! They have now decided its an issue with the device and I need to pay to fix it with vodaphone, however the device works fine with my EE sim!!They are taking no responsibility and ultimately I'm paying them for nothing each month.Will be escalating this to the ombudsman."

USELESS. Still stuck without internet,"Want to feel like you're on a desert island, except with pollution and trash around you, and have your wallet emptied for simply breathing? Vodafone will give you this wonderful feeling, plus a splitting headache.With a team of numpties whose collective IQ amounts to fewer than the earth's population of flamingos skating on ice in Antarctica, expect MONTHS of being cut off from the world wide web.Can you spell N.U.M.P.T.I.E.S. ? Keep working on it... I look forward to the day you can spell your own names correctly. Until then, I will have to borrow local cafe's wi-fi to let the world know how hard you blow.

Vodafone has stolen my money,"I gave vodafone ¬£200 several months ago to help out a friend who was travelling and needed more data.  They promised to credit her account but they never did.  They also refused to give me back the ¬£200 saying they had to talk to her first which they never did.  I think it is a disgrace to treat a good customer like this and, in addition, they have lowered the quality of the signal where I live and promised to fix but never have.  I would advise anyone to not get involved with Vodafone."

Poor business practice,"I was on a fixed contract and a fixed amount for two years, and they increased their prices by about 40% during the term. They don't call you after the end of the contract, and when the contract is completed, they will charge you exorbitant prices. When you try to cancel the account immediately, they will not cancel it then but ask you to wait for another month to milk more money out of you. If they want to keep customers, they should call them before the expiry and provide better deals to prevent them from switching to another supplier. I will never use their services again."

"Good phone service, poor shop service","Good service on the phone , poor service in the shop at  Clapham Junction.The phone service I received on Thursday evening at 6.30 to 7.00 from Rahul was really good and he tried hard to fix the problem.He suggested I go into the St.Johns Road shop at Clapham Junction for them to test and possibly replace the Sim card. At 9.00 am the operative spent two minutes on it and declared I needed a new phone because the speakers had gone.I asked him twice if he would try replacing the Sim card to see what happened. Twice he said no, it would make no difference.I wrnt round the corner to another phone shone shop and they fixed the problem in 20 minutes.Very disappointing.Update, after Vodafone said to reach out...the link they gave is unavailable."

Amazingly helpful and pleasant,"I am from London and was only staying in Deal for a few days. I went in because I thought I had a virus on my phone and Amber was so helpful and sorted it immediately. As the time was right I ended up changing my contract for a Talkmobile/Vodafone sim only which involved transferring my number of 25 years. I was very anxious because the transfer was delayed and I went into this store on two more occasions and everyone including Amber and Sean were very patient, professional and pleasant so that I stayed in Deal for extra days because I trusted them contrary to my past experiences in Wimbledon and other London stores. Many thanks once again.,"

And she lived happily ever after with her eSIM,"The tale is too long to recount so I will just hit the highlights. I bought a new iPhone 15 in the states not knowing what an eSIM card was only to discover that I needed to convert my UK number to an eSIM as well. There were many, many visits to my local shop in Bury trying to fix the matter. I always received excellent service and a kind smile. Brandon, John, the ‚ÄúRed Viking‚Äù as he is referred to and all the rest of the store where absolutely delightful! It took quite awhile but I now have a working UK eSIM card.

Worst customer service I've experienced,"Tried to sign up for home broadband fibre in July this year, I was unable to sign up online due to the website having so many issues not working at numerous stages, ended up on the phone for 5 hours over the course of 2 days before I could be signed up which meant I couldn't get the gift card offer I had seen online only to be claimed, I have spoken with comparethemarket about this as a third party and they've been really helpful trying to sort this out with me but have been facing issues as Vodafone have stopped replying to their queries, hopefully one day I will get my welcome offer. After spending all this time trying to sign up I was told my broadband wouldn't start until the 2nd September meaning I've had to go over a month without any internet in my home. During August when they were supposed to be getting openreach to do the external work on my property the initial work was marked up wrong so when the external team came they took one look at the makings and said it can't be done and the team needs to return. I have told this to Vodafone numerous times how no work was carried out and every time they simply tell me it is 95% completed and I must wait for my September date (which they pushed back to the 6th) for the work to be completed. I tried to tell them that when the engineer arrives he won't have any fiber to install without the work being completed prior but nobody would ever listen to me and insisted that the work was 95% completed and that I was mistaken. Low and behold the situation I kept warning them about trying to prevent happened when the engineer turned up, (a day early from the appointment they confirmed with me numerous times when I hadn't made any arrangements for someone to be in the property), and said the work couldn't be done off no external work had been completed which I had told them about many times. They then pushed my internet installation back to October (assuming there's no more issues like the many I've already faced). I have tried explaining this is costing me thousands between phone data add ons, preventing me from completing temporary work from home and being unable to apply for jobs as well. Between the loss of income and the many hours I've wasted speaking to them to gain absolutely nothing I would advise anyone looking to sign up to find another provider who will listen to you and help you solve your issues rather than pretending they aren't there."

Very dishonest Company,I purchased an extra 2gb of data on 5th August for ¬£12.30 and this lasted until my next bill on 13th August - I need this as a one off due to needing the data for a holiday - when my data renewed on 13th August I noticed that I had 12gb instead of the usual 10gb and then I realised that I had been charged another ¬£12.30 and that this was now a reoccurring charge (this was not clear to me when I paid for the extra data). I tried to cancel this reoccurring charge via the app and also via my browser but it wouldn't work. I therefore contacted Vodafone Chat to request that the reoccurring charge was removed from September. This was actioned but at the same time the 2gb of data I had already paid ¬£12.30 for was removed so I currently only have 10gb of data and because I am on holiday and having to tether I actually needed it. Vodafone Chat refuse to add the 2gb back to my account and also refuse to refund me the ¬£12.30 I paid for it. I have been with them for many years now and I find this very dishonest and have therefore completely lost faith in them. Just another rip off company that you cannot trust. I will never use them again. I also have my broadband with them so will be cancelling that as well and would not recommend them to anyone due to their dishonesty and lack of customer service

Priyanka's Tone and Service Towards me,"Priyanka's Tone and Service Towards meBrief ContextI recently joined Vodafone (after 15 years of being with EE) this Monday (02/09) and I was excited to start up with you guys to begin this new long relationship. I was told my new SIM would arrive by Thursday and my old one won't deactivate until I activate the new one. On Tuesday, my old SIM stopped working. I've been without service now for 4 days and the old SIM hasn't showed up! Priyanka's Compassion, Confidence & SolutionsI called in Friday to really eer my frustrations (from a disappointed heart). However, by the time I explained the story, Priyanka echoed my sentiment, explained the issue back to me and began looking to solve it. She asked investigatory questions (that didn't come up when I called previously on Wednesday) and it brought to light where things went wrong. She then made a good recommendation to go to a store to collect the new SIM instead of ordering a new one. On top of that, without me even asking, she said she will look into how she could compensate me for my days of no service. I was well compensated. Absolutely brilliant customer service! I am now ready to rekindle this honeymoon phase of being with Vodafone. Now all I want is for her to receive the recognition and praise she deserves. When I asked how I could help her, she said my words to her face already made her day and that's enough!

Amazing Experience,"I visited the Vodafone Shop in Paignton today and I just wanted to say what an incredibly informative, and positive, experience it was.I was immediately greeted with a welcoming smile by Beth - whose demeanour, by the way, was exemplary. I didn't go into the shop to actually purchase anything!I only went in to ask a few questions about a mobile hot spot and a sim only option - but I was treated with the same level of courtesy, and consideration, as If I was purchasing the most expensive deal in the shop. Beth listened intentively to my enquiries and, even though I tended to drone on a bit, she never once showed any sign of impatience or lack of interest: and, given the hectic climate in which we all have to co-exist these days, this was a very rare, but much appreciated, quality indeed. There is not much more I can say really: only to add that it was an absolute pleasure to deal with Beth today - and I cannot praise the level of the customer service I received from her, regarding my enquiry, highly enough. In conclusion, I would have no hesitation, whatsoever, in recommending The Vodafone Shop in Paignton and would encourage anyone with a Vodafone enquiry to pay a visit to the shop and definitely have a word with Beth. Top marks all round."

Flawless changeover from previous Fibre ISP,"Simple to order online.  Switch from ISP was scheduled quickly and the HUB was delivered fast.  Simply plugged in and switched on , on the morning of the switchover, I went out and came back 20 minutes later and my new Fibre connection was set-up.  Flawless and connection speed UP & down is bang on !  Have used for several days with zero drops.My first Fibre ISP (Gigabit Networks) sold me and load others to another ISP (Home Fibre) who messed up my connection when they did some maintenance several weeks ago.  Sadly they couldn't fix their mess and I had to move ISP as I work from home and hence rely on a stable connection.   My previous connection was unworkable so I had to resort to my old 4G SIM router as my main connection for work, which I'm now keeping as back-up.As I have many Vodafone sims for my families phones I decided to go with Vodafone Broadband, which I'm really happy with that decision."

"I'll pass on V's from now on (vodafone, virgin)","I recently left virgin because occasionally the internet would go out and they were charging me ¬£70 a month for 350mbit. I figired based on the reviews here being mostly good, vodafone would be good (I was wrong) after switching to vodaphone for the first 1-2 days. it was great, 900+ dwn and up but after 1-2 days, it refused to connect to the internet properly. I say properly because we could access the internet, but only a few of the big websites worked (YouTube, amazon, Microsoft) while other large sites such as steam, twitter and discord refused to connect (on both wifi or lan), after a few days trying to figure it out ourselves we got nowhere, the Router provided is really locked down, so that didn't help.Eventually I called support, after a few hours they said they will call the next day and if its still not working they'll send a new router, get a call, its still not working get told to go through troubleshooting again and that they will ""send a new cable"" wifi problems and two lan routes... (They were not talking about from the fiber to router but one of our lan connections) I talked then into sending a new router, due to a few reasons the router was set to arrive later than intended and would arrive after the free period (you have 14 days to leave for free) I wasnt willing to gamble if everything would be ok after the new router came, as if it were still crap I would leave and have to pay a fair chunk of money so I called and cancelled my vodafone After the new router came outside the free period, it worked great the internet worked again, and I kind of regretted leaving, however by the next day it stopped working again. I usually dont advise people to stay away from certain companies, but for this it was bad enough that I advised the people living by me not to, mostly because often people in the same area tend to have the same problems.(As a side note, part of me feels like it could be a problem on the fiber connection, though I dont feel like its likely, I'll update this review sometime in october as if my problems persist into a new isp, its could be a problem outside of vodafone)Heres a weird tidbit: the internet problem broke the internet for windows, android and iphone, but linux seemed to be completly fine"
Absolutely appalling customer support,"Absolutely appalling customer support. Broadband wasn't working. Phoned the customer helpline over 2 days. For example I have had 32 phone calls with Vodafone and still no attempt at a resolution. One of these calls I was on the call over 45 minutes, another over 30 minutes on hold. Policy appears to be just talk at the customer until they give up and go away. I'll be leaving Vodafone as soon as I possibly can. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!The reply below from Vodafone is from a bot. Every negative review on here has the same reply"
Amazing service!,"Nathan at the shop was very knowledgeable and experienced with everything we asked him while upgrading my phone, he was very friendly with me and my family and the service was ten out of ten. I would come back to this shop next time especially if Nathan was working."
Izzy,"Izzy, who dealt with me regarding the Broadband moving house was very helpful and extremely patient. It took more than an hour due to very poor chat support which we've used with her to sort out my request. But she provided an excellent support and solve the problem for me.

The plans are reasonably priced, and the customer service has always been helpful when I've needed assistance. Most of the time, the coverage is great, and I get good speeds for browsing and streaming.However, there are a few spots where the signal drops or gets weaker, which can be a bit frustrating at times. If they could improve the coverage in those areas, it would be perfect. Still, a reliable service for the most part!"
Avoid Vodafone under any circumstances,Avoid Avoid Avoid ! Do not trust Vodafone to provide WiFi broadband in your home made me wait for 2 weeks that engineer will come on the 29th and on the 29th engineer came done half of the job and since then Vodafone keeps lying to me that engineer will come today tomorrow they keep giving me false dates I since then keep taking off work and then until 6pm no one comes . Do not trust Vodafone with your broadband or any service they are lying I am filling a complaint and going to sue them for making me off work . Keep sending me messages that engineer will come but then no one comes I have all the evidence and proof ! Avoid do not trust them . Do not sign the contract they convince you to sing the contract and then left on hold you have to keep making fone calls nothing will help you . Very disappointed
Substandard customer service,"I have an elderly iPhone 5 which is on it's last legs. An upgrade is needed, not least because the screen is cracked and the battery runs out very quickly. I do not want to upgrade online or by speaking to someone on the phone, I want to go into my store, but alas, the customer services lady on the main Vodafone number did not seem to really understand, nor supply me with a phone number for the store which I wanted to use ahead of going in to check what I needed. I am concerned about any loss of data too, and wanted reassurance this would not happen. Then I tried to go into my account and for love or money the system would not accept my password, or any others I tried to create. I have wasted a whole hour trying to get this sorted. I read with envy how others have gone into stores and had their problems sorted. The store here doesn't even have a functioning phone number. It's enough to make you want to switch providers, but why should I? I've been with vodafone for 7 years, but am seriously disillusioned by such poor customer service. Please DON'T send me the usual social media links as you do to others - they are no help to me at all. Actually I'd just like to speak to a human who understands what I need. Is that so much to ask?"

Phone sims not working correctly,"Today I popped in with an issue with my one number not working and Sully the store manager gave me some advice and who I need to contact to get the issue sorted. I also needed some help with the fact my phones sim tried to duplicate itself as an eSIM so both sims were fighting each other essentially which he sorted for me. Later on I called the technical team to sort my one number connection for my apple watch and it completely stop my phone services from working which also ended the call the the techs and I couldn‚Äôt get back hold of them, incidentally my Apple Watch is still not working. I went back to see Sully and he sorted me out a new physical sim for the time being before I contact the technical team again with the issue with my watch. All in all Sully gave me some amazing service in store and fully recommend them if you do have any issues."

"PUK, s at Vodafone",Warning vodafone block people from using their phones for no apparent reason by demanding PUK numbers and a lot of their staff do not know how to deal with it and they leave you unable to access your phone for days on end. This happened to me 3 times in 3 months. This problem is specific to Vodafone ( see PUK on Google)  the only way I could get round the problem was to change to another network which is what I have done

Couldn‚Äôt be better,"I don‚Äôt really do reviews but the people in the East Dereham shop were outstanding! I had to return a phone and the Voda/Voxi online people  had absolutely messed the return up leaving me no alternative than to, reluctantly, visit a shop. Because of what the online people had done the shop staff struggled but after some time and some calls they were eventually able to take the phone back - for which I was very grateful. To be honest if I‚Äôd had the slightest inkling of what a complete mess the webchat / twitter / Facebook people would make of a simple return I‚Äôd have avoided them and gone straight to the East Dereham shop. (Voda have replied and said ‚ÄúWe're glad you had such a positive experience with us‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt have had a worse experience with the online side of Voda / Voxi. However the service from the shop was certainly positive.)"
Shocking treatment of my 80 year old‚Ä¶,"Shocking treatment of my 80 year old mother who is not tech-savvy. Sending her from pillar to post, expecting her to travel from home to the nearest Vodafone shop to speak to staff who have previously refused to help, referring her back to Vodafone HQ.When you're 80 and your phone appears dead and you're dealing with Vodafone who are telling you access PAC numbers sent by text to a dead phone what are you supposed to do? The Windsor shop won't help. They didn't even think to take the sim from the dead phone and put it in a working phone to access the information Vodafone HQ claim they have texted. To add insult to injury, as Vodafone shops are franchises, they (the shop in Windsor) won't speak to Vodafone HQ in order to assist my mother, even when she's standing in the store. No wonder Windsor Vodafone has a review score of 2.3/5.I'm disgusted by the failure of this mobile giant and its franchises to support customers who don't have laptops and struggle with doing more than making calls - vulnerable customers who have a mobile for emergencies but, of course, don't spend money on data so aren't of interest. Shame on you VODAFONE for your indifference to her plight. If this wasn't enough, she's told me tonight she doesn't want to be in this world when everything is so difficult for her. The way you have treated her over the last 24-48 hours is largely responsible for the depths of despair she is in.Can I suggest you read your published 'Supporting Vulnerable Customers' charter and reflect on how you could have done things differently?"

Something not rigth with online place orders,"I tried to switch my broadband from my provider to Vodafone and I did this online, I gave my details, bank details, and card number, and I submitted my order online, they sent me the contract to my email and my order didn't go through, I contacted customer service and they want me to do everything again and give my details to the customer service. I refused, to give again my details and bank account details and now they said that my name doesn't appear on their system. Should I have to worry? will they set a direct debit when I do not appear on their system?"
Not satisfied,"I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with Vodafone's 5G Internet service. Despite your claims of high-speed and reliable connectivity, my experience has been quite the opposite. The 5G signal is often weak or nonexistent, leading to frequent disconnections and slow internet speeds. This has severely impacted my ability to work from home and stream content seamlessly. I urge Vodafone to address these issues promptly and improve the quality of its 5G network to meet customer expectations."
Ruin my chances of mortgage,"Ruining my chances of getting a mortgage due to total mishandling of my account.Vodafone opened 2 accounts for me, one is the one they deem as my main account, the other is the one I knew nothing of and that they sent to a debt collection agency. Now I have paid all debts 5 weeks ago they are unable to see the two accounts are linked. My case has been escalated and now Vodafone are refusing to let me speak to anyone about my case. They said in 24 hours I should get a call. Nothing. I call after 48 hours, they refuse again, saying I need to wait 3-5 days for someone to call. A total shambles! I am being passed from pillar to post and nobody will help sort the mistake Vodafone made in the first place. I am waiting on this so I can get a mortgage and may lose my first house due to their incompetence. I have a baby on the way and this company is ruining my life."

Thieves and useless,Thieves and useless. After many times contacting vodafone they don‚Äôt do nothing but rob you. Tried taking out a broadband from them and then 7months later they still couldn‚Äôt install it. I ended up telling them to just cancel it because every week they were telling me we will come next week then two weeks and just kept delaying it. Fast forward to now IVE BEEN GETTING CHARGED SINCE without them telling me and they said i‚Äôm not eligible for compensation. They have everything saying i‚Äôve cancelled it and now telling me there‚Äôs no evidence so i‚Äôm not eligible for compensation how ridiculous. After loads of calls still nothing they still won‚Äôt cancel. IM NOT EVEN USING IT AND DONT EVEN HAVE THE BOX!!? It‚Äôs stupid pathetic and unprofessional.

I can never get a signal,"I cannot wait until my contract expires as I can hardly ever get a phone signal and on the rare time I can get one, my mobile usually cuts off.  I dread having to use my phone now if I need to make any call that is likely to last more than a few minutes.  Luckily I have a landline at home so at least if I am at home I can ask people to call me on that instead if we get cut off.  Dreadful"

Humans like Taz make all the difference at Vodafone,"I‚Äôve been a Vodafone customer for many years, partly because of Taz in the Durham office. Taz have overseen all my contract changes since I moved to Durham in 2019 and he is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. He has more patience than I do with chat bots and saves a busy professional lots of time by being an expert in his field. It makes such a difference to be able to talk someone like Taz and, based on my experience with automated services, I feel confident I would have left Vodafone long ago."

Then after another lengthy wait I am told there was an error and they will raise the refund request. This has happened 4 times now over a period of 4 months. I am still waiting for the refund. Also, I request an email transcript each time and it is NEVER sent. I will never go back to Vodafone."

Eric was very helpful,"Eric was very helpful, would request to deal with him again. Went above and beyond, altogether a good sales experience"
Very poor,"Very poor! I was only with them for 3 months where i incurred drops and lag spikes. This was acknowledged by Vodafone and their only solution was to move to Pro2 which obviously costs more and would tie me into a longer contract(Don't think so) After 4 hours in their webchat, being transferred from CS to cancellations to tech team to easy switch back to tech team back to cancellations team, they wouldn't terminate the contract and said i would need to pay the termination fees although they cant fulfil their side of the contract - Scumbags! If your reading this, dont waste your time. Also, Vodafone if you are reading this than please do not respond with you AI responses. I'm sending the transcript to PSA & Ofcom - Kind of disgusting!"

Well they still owe me ¬£7.99 for the deposit. The company is a joke. I would never go with them again even if they paid me.

I saw Aziz on 31st August,"I saw Aziz on 31st August.  He advised a deal of ¬£21 a month discounted to ¬£18 - I was getting SIM only.  He asked for my phone and used it to send a text.  I signed but felt ok because I know you have 2 weeks to change your mind.  Over the weekend I found better deals - one for ¬£9 for the same data.   I went back to the shop but Aziz was not there and I saw someone else - I said that I didn't want the deal.  He asked for the SIM back and to ring 191.  But it was too late.  When Aziz texted he had asked for the PAC code and guess what? had set it up - transferred it straightaway.  This I understand is not always the case.  I did not give permission.  From now on please explain what you are doing when you ask for phones to text.  Let people know when you are asking for a PAC code and give them the information on the consequences and the option to consider and do it themselves.  The person I saw today as Aziz was still not in the shop, conceded that Aziz is a good salesman.  My experience does not describe that."

VODAPHONIES::: 14 DAYS legal cooling off period NOT IF VODAPHONE CAN HELP IT!!!,"On Saturday I bought a tv at Curry‚Äôs and was persuaded   into purchasing a Vodaphone 24 month contract based on Umesh‚Äôs sales pitch which wasn‚Äôt entirely factual or accurate.   I‚Äôd left Now broadband after a very poor 8 months of abysmal Wi-Fi connection. It was interesting to hear all these positive sales pitches but short lived when I checked them out the following day, Sunday.On Sunday I had realized I‚Äôd made a mistakedecided to cancel Vodaphone broadband legally entitled to do within the 14 day cooling off period.  This is where the nightmare begins.I Spoke to two South African women and one Indian male who all work for Vodaphone. They obstructed my attempts to leave within 14 cooling off period.  They falsely said I hadn‚Äôt met security clearance and they produced a concoction of falsehood saying I had had another account. That I couldn‚Äôt possibly verify as it was false.  This became everyone‚Äôs excuse for being unable to cancel the contract during the 14 day cooling off period.  At the end of which would I be liable to pay VODAPHONE an exit fee for the whole 24 months?.   On Monday I tried to cancel once again and again I spoke to another South African Woman employee of Vodaphone.  For at least 40 minutes. She to was adamant I couldn‚Äôt leave for lack of answering security questions.  Fixated on a four digit PIN number. Not once was I asked to verify my bank acc. Details.  You know as a security question.That‚Äôs credible. They harped on about a 4 digit PIN number for an account which doesn‚Äôt relate to me. Ever. I asked to speak to a manager. An English man with an English accent claimed he was the manager.  He promised to close the account and to verify this by calling me today, Tuesday.  He didn‚Äôt.  Another liar.I called THEM again today, Tuesday. I Spoke to Liam for 30 minutes.He also blathered on about my not passing security questions.  He advised me that Umesh had not provided my phone number, my security details nor a third vital security thing.  I‚Äôm advised by Liam, who refused to give his surname or the office he worked at, it‚Äôs location. He said he was from Yorkshire‚Äù,  he definitely wasn‚Äôt a Yorkshire lad.  Liam advised I go back to Curry‚Äôs. I did. I physically called into Curry‚Äôs. Now remember I started to request a cancellation on Sunday it is Tuesday and I have not resolved it.When I arrived at Curry‚Äôs Umesh was really narked that I was canceling.  Umesh has to phone Vodaphone then he hands the receiver to me whereby the guy from VODO-//// starts withering on about a load of BS.  The message is, VODAPHONE WILL NOT LET Me or whoever LEAVE UNDER THE 14 day cooling off period‚Ä¶. Period!!!!! It‚Äôs a scam. After 14 days I‚Äôll be presented with an out of contract fee for 24 months.  I AM EXHAUSTED.The VODO::::: bloke speaks to Umesh advised him to send an email to VODO//:: on my behalf explaining that I DO NOT WANT TO BE A CUSTOMER AND CANCEL this CONTRACT.I saw the email Umesh sent off.  I have a copy.  There wasn‚Äôt a TO: address or a TO: name an addressee!!!!!!    name!!!! Where was it going to?I have to deal with the dilemma of an engineer turning up at my door.  I have no control of this situation.Open reach have created an engineer‚Äôs appointment at my home for 16/09/24. Without my consent. I cannot reach out to cancel it. Apparently I have to ask VODAPHONE to cancel.  Good luck with that.Is there anyone who can help me step out of this living nightmare. I don‚Äôt know what to do next.   How do I get these morons to just cancel during the 14 day cooling off period which is a legally binding agreement. Vodaphone concocted a web of farcical lies to prevent me closing down this contract.I have never been a VODAPHONE customer EVER.  So who created this fictional narrative?.I‚Äôve received emails advising a router is on its way too.  Will it be my responsibility to pay for its return.Just unbelievable .Who would want to deal with people who treat other people with so much unkindness and contempt. I I know, Vodaphonies.Vodo = abbrev for Vodaphone.Tomorrow is Wednesday I will have to contact Citizens Advice and appropriate Ombudsman.  Once again, if someone has a helpful solution I‚Äôd appreciate it. I AM INCLUDING A RESPONSE TO VODAPHONE‚ÄôS reply,I HAVE RECEIVED a reply from Vodaphone see below.  However, Vodaphone have not given me an email address to respond to their reply.  I do not have Facebook or any of the other sites used to communicate by certain people using ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù.  There‚Äôs enough info for you to cancel.    If Vodaphone could please just cancel.  I will reply once I receive a line of communication that I can use.  But thanks for responding.I‚Äôve sent an email to Max Taylor CEO of Vodaphone explaining.  Vodaphone has included several positive reviews from customers just TO DILUTE THE AWFULNESS OF MY EXPERIENCE, at the foot of my complaint.IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. What an attitude!!!"

Hello Vodaphone,"Hello VodaphoneMy nightmare continues with you.It is impossible for me to contact you other than via trustpilot or visit a store 20 miles away. You have no email  address that works for me. Your chatbot does not work and I fail to answer the security questions you ask me on the phone.This morning despite having already initiated a complaint regarding the purchase of my device and the aftermath I receive a message saying you are about to charge me for ""Secure Net"" whatever that is. Something I've  not heard of and something I certainly did not request. As it is I have cancelled a direct debit with you which  should never have commenced . My debt  to you was paid off in full in store within 14 days but the  contract not cancelled as I was informed it would be.Not sure how you intend to deduct money from my account? My direct debit has been cancelled. I have a monthly sim only contract to supply my Internet services with Talkmobile. I simply went to your store to buy a new cell phone. No other services were requested or required. Simply a phone to replace the broken phone I previously bought from you!Still awaiting to hear from you regarding my complaint.Update 5/9/24Well done to ""Georgina"" and the complaints team. Acknowledgement and an apology for this nightmare. Really should not have happened in the first place. I guess that's the problem when companies prefer to rely on technology rather than employ people. Computers are only as good as the people who program them. Net result. Debt written off, one payment of ¬£35 to be returned and ""Secure net"" cancelled."
Our visit was to consultant Alina,"Our visit was to consultant Alina, she helped us professionally, quickly and promptly, explained all the advantages of the new contract and also possible prospects and opportunities.

Vodafone can not communicate with BT‚Ä¶,"Vodafone can not communicate with BT Open Reach or their customers effectively when an issue arrises.  If I could give them a negative rating below one star I would. My partner took out a Broadband Fibre 1 to our new build property on the 20th June 2024.  Today I had the 4th BT engineer call to connect us (despite the issue with a blocked tube not being resolved). He told me that Vodafone would have been aware our issue was unresolved and should not have made yet another appointment to connect us. So not only my time but the engineers time has been wasted yet again!Each time they make an appointment I have to take time off work, which would be fine if they actually got us connected.I had a nightmare trying to get past the AI that is now answering/screening their calls and on more than one occasion when I do get to speak to a human their accent is so strong that it makes understanding their English impossible.They do not listen. I was not telephoning them to discussing our account that is only in my husbands name.  I wanted to make the point that they need to improve on their communications with BT Open reach so that our issue is resolved.  I am dreading what my Husband is going to say when he gets home to find out that yet again Vodafone have failed to connect us.Party in a wet paper bag is what I am now thinking when I hear the name Vodafone.  I thank my lucky stars my mobile is with EE or I would be very depressed about having to speak with them again.My advice is AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! A SERVICE IS ONLY AS GOOD AS ITS CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM AND VODAFONE IS SERIOUSLY LACKING!"

Bad services ever,"I don't recommend Vodafone home broadband service.  I started to use Vodafone's home broadband since May 2024.  The signal was not table in the first month which made me had difficulties to work from home.  In early August, I called and messaged Vodafone that I will be moving to a new house, they promised several times to me that there will be no issue in moving.  Vodafone even sent me a new router so that I can use the boardband services in both the new and old homes simultaneously in several days during the transition.  However, after I returned the old router to Vodafone as agreed, my service in my new home was terminated.  I called several times and they kept connecting me to different teams, however, my broadband service was still disconnected after 4 days.  It's obviously that Vodafone terminated my services but the company refused to admit their issues but keep saying that this is the issue from Openreach.  Vodafone is not a reliable company, that's why I don't"

flood of instore reviews,vodafone has ranked itself high all of a sudden... then you realise the reviews are made instore about the store experience NOT THE NETWORK EXPERIENCE!
I would not recommend Vodafone,"I would not recommend Vodafone. I broke my phone, it was due an upgrade- however, my phone contract is in my fathers account. We collectively called Vodafone and the whole process took 3 HOURS, the system kept shutting down, and then when it eventually worked the phone I ordered wasn't in stock, eventually we found one that was in stock but was ¬£200 more, and we had to go through the whole process again. Eventually, we agreed to get it ordered to the shop for me to pick up my phone (which my father had given phone permission for and Vodafone agreed it would be possible for me to pick up) only for me to go to the store, and them to say I can't pick it up.My father then tried to call customer service back and change the name of the account and couldn't get hold of anyone. I can't wait to cancel my contract, the whole process is slow and everyone who works there is a slave to their useless catch-22 system."

Vodafone has poor customer service and a poor fraudulent team.,"Vodafone on a whole has terrible customer service. I've been with you for 20 years, I've reported a Fraudulent. case to you and you deemed it was not fraudulent, even though I wasn't around at that time to be able to report it or even try and stop it from happening Nobody even got back to me. They sent it through on a text message. Then when I rung back to speak to Vodafone, someone told me they sent me an email asking me to give information on how I could prove that it wasn't me in which I replied to this email only to get a different response, which was completely nothing to do with the fraudulent case. I don't think Vodafone care for their customers anymore. And it sad because it's actually making me really ill trying to sort this out."
Great local team,"Initial impressionsKevin was friendly and welcoming and his manner and words presented as someone who wanted to help. My wife and I felt instantly that this was someone we could do business with.The processHaving explained what we needed (overseas access) Kevin identified a better solution with a specific tariff. This persuaded us to move two phones to Vodafone, one with the recommended tariff (which met the need).We were taken through the contract and all appeared to have proceeded smoothly.There was, however, a hiccup with one phone porting. Unlike some businesses where you are left to call a helpline and spend hours going round in circles, Kevin was personally on the case, ably supported by his colleagues when he was not in the office.Sometimes things do go wrong and that is when you really find out the calibre of who you are dealing with. Kevin took personal interest and responsibility to sort out the issue and presently as a competent and professional individual who is an asset to the business."

After two months the phone has a line on the screen, I take it to repairs to the Washington Vodaphone shop in north east and less than two week after, the line is back on the screen. So the phone is not being used for over two weeks and still needs to be paid for plus airtime. You chat with TOBI or wait unend to speak to no one. Customer service is absolutely zero.

Terrible coverage - ""E"" is the best it achieves in Herefordshire despite claims of excellent 4G coverage. We can't make calls from inside the house, we need to stand in the garden to get a signal - just three miles outside a city in an area where every other mobile network works. Customer service is non-existent. Almost impossible to get to speak to a human and when you do the response is that they have an amazing network so shut up. Why, why, why have I been so loyal? Time for a change I think. FURTHER NOTE: Your response to my review kind of proves my point. You suggest I contact Vodafone either via Facebook or X - I use neither, nor any other social media. So that's that then. Polite suggestion - maybe offer alternative ways of contacting Vodafone for those of us who don't use social media."

Cheaper broadband but inferior service,"I recently moved from Sky broadband to Vodafone but beware the WiFi does not stretch through the house (I live in a small house). Most areas drop in connection but apparently the hub is the same quality as Sky - I disagree. I never had a problem with the Sky hub, it even reached out into the garden. If you choose to sign up to Vodafone be prepared to buy boosters as Vodafone are not willing to help you out with this unless you pay them more! Of course. Update: Connection has now dropped in all areas. Advice for all potential customers - please be aware of Vodafone‚Äôs inferior hub/connection. And Vodafone, yes I know I can get boosters but you want more money for them! I don‚Äôt expect to pay for a service I should already be getting."

Literally ten times slower than BT for the same service,"Upload speeds on Vodafone in practical use is literally ten times slower for me than on BT.Vodafone appear to be usin throttling or traffic shaping techniques to do this and applying this to certain online services. Notably Google Services which includes Google Drive and YouTube. The sneaky thing here, is that speed tests are unaffected, which means my upload speed is always at 100meg+. As soon as I upload a file to Google Drive or YouTube, the upload speed is consistently restricted to 10meg.How do I know? 1. The problem started immediately after switching to Vodafone.2. I tested like for like, using two separate ISP connections (Vodafone and EE), and even additionally by switching to a 4G connection on the same device.3. I confirmed that the upload speed is uncapped when using a VPN service.I can find other reports of the same online, including throttling of VPNs and streaming services for video and games.Additionally, the supplied router (PowerHub) is almost unusable since it locks down all the settings and doesn't allow simple features to be configured such as the splitting of SSIDs and other features that basic routers have.I would love to switch to EE since I'm still in my cooling off period, but it will leave me without internet for two weeks and this isn't feasible as someone that works from home.My advice - Avoid Vodafone."

"Not even worth 1 star, been with Vodafone nearly 10 years and I‚Äôm ashamed","End of July this issue has been going one, constantly taking money from us. The customer service we have received is DISGUSTING, it‚Äôs beyond Ridiclous my partner this morning has spoken to 6 different advisors, each one asking same questions, do your team not have the facility to read a chat, why should we have to explain and come back and write our issue each time, it‚Äôs beyond repetitive and we are emotionally drained.My partner have paid ¬£50 over his device plan, after we complained my partner got a ¬£3.15 Costa voucher ( which is not even worth a drink these days ) He was then PROMISED ( we have screenshots of your advisors promising) the device plan was ended and he would never be charged again. He then ‚Ä¶ of course was charged at the end of the month after another promise, which meant he missed a DD payment for his insurance, because of you. He then complained again and was told the ¬£50 would be refunded into his account by 1st September he was told he would get compensation either way now because of how long this has been ongoing, my partner trusted the advisor as he explained how this was causing issues, the advisor told Alex he would get his money back and the device plan was done. If we owed you money, we would be in trouble so tell me why on earth it‚Äôs ok for you to owe your customers money. We will be walking into a Vodafone shop and will not leave the store if this is not sorted. I will also, complain on every social media platform, a Costa voucher will not cut this. Shameful to loyal customers, I would never recommend you guys again. VODAFONE TAKES MONEY, we have proof."

Nico restored my hope for humanity,"To express how exceptional the staff at this branch are, I first need to share my experience. I previously visited another Vodafone branch (which I won‚Äôt name) where the staff didn‚Äôt explain the transaction I requested. They took my card for ‚Äúidentity verification‚Äù without telling me what was going on, and I was unexpectedly signed up for a package with fees I hadn‚Äôt agreed to. The initial price I was quoted for the tariff was different, and during the process, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to review the details or confirm my approval.Now, onto the Vodafone Victoria branch. As soon as I entered, I felt a calm and welcoming atmosphere. When I explained the problem I had at the other branch, Nico went above and beyond to help me. I want to express my gratitude for his efforts. Throughout our nearly hour-long interaction, he clearly explained each step to reverse the unauthorized transactions and ensured the right tariff was applied to my account. He made sure to get our approval before proceeding at each stage. I am truly thankful for his honesty and dedication. It‚Äôs comforting to know there are people like him who genuinely care about customers."

Vodaphone James!,"Lovely young man in the vodaphone shop, James. He explained all the options to me and was very knowledgeable and cheerful."
I regret switching to Vodafone Part 1,"While others have had five-star treatment, my experience is dramatically different.ORDER AND PREINSTALLATIONI ordered Vodafone Home Full Fibre 500 on 18 July to be installed on 21 August when my contract ended with the previous provider.I received a raft of email messages with various bits of information including creating an online account. That was a nightmare. I first got an error message saying that my account did not exist. I thought ""fair enough"" let me wait a few days. Over the next several days I got the same error message.Then one day I decided to try the LOGIN button instead of the REGISTER button and sure enough it said password incorrect. So I did FORGOT PASSWORD and received a temporary password. Then lo and behold failure either because account did not exist or account locked - try again in 30 minutes. An on and on the drama continued.I contacted customer service more than once (I believe via chat as I could not find a telephone number). First after much effort and putting me on hold I was told my account will be created after the service goes live try again after 21 August. Okay that is fair, BUT ‚Ä¶ if that is the case WHY send me email instructions to register? Bizarre.A few days later in comes another email confirming Direct Debit instructions and asked me to login into my account to confirm they are correct. Surely these people are joking.So I returned to the login saga and after the predictable failure, I insisted through their chat that I get a telephone number for their customer service. I was reluctantly provided with one. As it turns out I was told to use Microsoft Edge browser only and that my username will be my email address in CAPITAL LETTERS.SERIOUSLY? Why did Vodafone not say that in their email or on the login page? When we use a website, the web analytics producers a log file with a wealth of data including what type of browser I am using. The website can 'see' that I am using Chrome and should have 'told' me to use MS Edge instead. Secondly, if I type the username in lowercase it can also 'see' that and 'instruct' me otherwise.At this point I was seriously considering returning to my previous provider and read the fine print to learn that the 14-day cooling off period started with activation of the service.That's tech failure #1 for a tech company and customer service failure #1INSTALLATION CHECKOn 5 August at 12pm I got a text message confirming the installation due on 21 August and said they needed to check the equipment & set up. I needed to respond YES or NO if I had access to the property.Now that was ambiguous to me because it could relate to more than one scenario. Either I was moving to a new property and I either had or did not yet have access to the property. Or I could be out at the pub and I was currently not at home. I was hesitant to answer NO because I feared there might be a negative outcome.As it happens I was at work and thought I would wait until I got home to answer YES because they evidently might want me to check stuff.Before I could get home in comes another impatient text ""We haven't heard form you & it's important that we check a few things to get your service activate...""What's the problem? Do you think I am sitting around all day long at home twiddling my thumbs and waiting for your call? Does my life revolve around yours or should your service fit in with my schedule?Customer service failure #2 for being so intolerant, demanding and inconsiderate.INSTALLATIONInstallation instructions were as clear as mud.The ports of the hub are colour-coded. Red for WAN and yellow for LAN. The cable came with a yellow connector but oddly also with a WAN and a LAN sticker each on it. Silly me to think that I should match yellow to yellow and so I stuck it into the LAN port and nothing happened. I then plugged it into the WAN port a few minutes later and the service came alive.Customer service failure # 3... continued in Part 2 ..."

What a difference between Meadowhall and Parkgate,"After two trips to Meadowhall we were very despondent, our experiences were not what we had come to expect from Vodafone as long standing customers. We decided not to return a third time but to go to Parkgate. I must say the experience was so different. They cleared up all the confusion about what we could have and when, they answered all our questions and when we left the store we had new contracts that we were happy with. Darren and Ross made the effort to listen and find the best option for us. The process of new contracts was so easy and straightforward in comparison. I would definitely return to Parkgate in the future. Great customer service."

I went on chat and asked to have the customer service email address to raise a complaint. 100 minutes and lots of typing later , the Supervisor raised a complaint on my behalf...the complaint team would respond within 7 days? To be fair I got an email from CS on the 29th...they too said they tried calling my number to chat....the same number they can't connect....the insult to the intelligence keep slapping around the face!So far 3 times, Vodafone ,have stated that they have tried ringing me to talk...?I asked to be emailed a PAC code to leave,resulting in that apparently I can't ,because I haven't actually got an account to leave. 6 hours is the longest it has taken for any company to at least allow me to make calls...

Soon be the end of contract thank goodness. Goodbye to rubbish."
A total shambles.,"I am a long standing mobile customer of Vodafone (V). I  recently decided to change Broadband from BT to V and separately swap my mobile handset for a newer one. After a laborious time on the phone to set this up I decided later that day to check on progress - to be told V had decided to cancel the mobile swap and not tell me. I then had to do the ordering all over again. The next day I called V once more to check on progress and, unbelievably, was told they had decided to cancel it again, once more without telling me (I was also advised the simple mobile handset sim swap would now require me to be cut off for up to 24 hours!). To make matters even worse this cancellation also included BB that was to be set up a few days later. The reason given by V was BT did not cooperate with them. However, BT confirmed to me they were never even asked by V!   Conclusion: From start to finish this whole episode was a total shambles and reflects very badly indeed on V, notwithstanding some very modest compensation promised in the form of a credit against future invoices - that I note has not been activated in my most recent bill over a week later‚Ä¶.."

So I went to their shop. The staff not able to find out the problem, because on my account there is no outstanding balance. And even him not able to reach their credit team. The only way he can do is he made a complaint for me and ask me to go home wait for someone to contact me within 10 days. What a service !!! Imagine if you apply for a loan or a mortgage now!

"No broadband since 20/08,fault‚Ä¶","No broadband since 20/08,fault reported. Told engineer was out 22/08. I get a call 23/08 telling me I need an appointment to come into my property but I can only have an am or pm slot. I work so cannot be home until 4.45 and live on my own,lady on the phone rather rude. I told her at the start of the call I only had 15mins left on my lunch,however kept repeating same question. I said I had to go and to book in for 28th as that was the 1st appointment they had and to send me confirmation, nothing received. Tried live chat, the person on the end was useless and couldn't answer my questions. Called them 23rd,spoke to a lovely chap who said it is an external problem and will get sorted. Imagine my surprise when I get another call 24th to say I need to book an appointment for them to come into my property. I tried to explain that was not what I had been told,again sadly she had no customer skills at all and I was asking questions she didn't know how to answer. I asked to raise a complaint to which she told me I would be wasting my time,not impressed to say the least. Got my appointment booked for today,pm slot. This morning a text and email from Vodafone to inform me an engineer will not be visiting my property. Called them to which I was told could not confirm or deny if they need to come in as they are not an engineer. I only Called to see if my appointment is going ahead and still not sure. I've been with them for years and disgusting service and still no broadband after 10 days. UPDATE. This is to the response I have received below. Firstly telling me how to check for faults and where to go,obviously I have done that or you would not be aware there was a fault. Secondly telling me to go to live chat was useless the first time as they could not answer any questions so why would I try again. Thirdly it seems to be hit and miss talking to someone as there has only been 1 person out of 4 that I had spoken to that was polite and could even answer any questions,I do work for a living and cannot spend all my spare time on the  phone. Also to add insult to injury I had a call from yourselves as soon as I left work telling me they would update me once they had a response from an engineer, what was the point of the call,I asked her this question and all she could tell me was it was to let me know they would respond once they had an update,even she couldn't explain the point of this. As for everyone telling me I will automatically get compensation is now getting ridiculous,doesn't even cover the services I pay for elsewhere that I cannot use,or the inconvenience this is causing"

They 'accidentally' disconnected my‚Ä¶,They 'accidentally' disconnected my number. This is my business number and it has been disconnected since Tuesday 27th of August. It is now Thursday 29th of August and I am still without my business number. I own a mini coach business that does school contracts and various other work and no one can get a hold of me.They keep saying its a vodafone issue. Its not. The salesperson disconnected my number. I have no idea how much business i have lost through this.Today the 29th of August I am still disconnected.Take my advice and stay away from this Vodafone franchise I don't have social media to contact you. You can get my email address from the store and email me. I am still disconnected Absolutely disgraceful
Appalling Service - Definitely would not recommend,"I have tried 4 times to cancel a contract that I did not ask for or want.  Vodafone thought that I did and proceeded with setting it up anyway.  During my online chat, I made it explicitly clear that I did not want to change from my Voxi contract.  I was only told about a 24 month contract at the end of the chat.  That is when I said I DO NOT WANT TO PROCEED.   have spent ¬£9.00 with you for no reason and have been told I will receive a credit of ¬£6.10.  I have spent several hours sorting this out and have asked for a goodwill payment to compensate for my time.  This has been ignored.  I now have to contact you for a 5th time to resolve this.  Appalling customer service and I can only conclude that Vodafone does not want my business.  I will take my hard earned money elsewhere."
Good service,"Lucy was very helpful, explained all the options and made sure we got the most appropriate package available."
I ended my Vodafone mobile contract in‚Ä¶,"I ended my Vodafone mobile contract in July. Despite receiving 3 emails confirming my Together me discount would remain in place for the remainder of my broadband contract, which expires in October 2025. Vodafone have not honoured this and have removed the discount. I have currently spent the last hour on the phone (1hr 7mins to be precise,and still on hold) to Vodafone who, despite the emails clearly stating the terms seem incapable of resolving this. This company has the worst customer service possible. Thanks for wasting my time Vodafone."

"Cancelled my order, after telling my existing ISP to cancel my service.","Went through their website to switch broadband to them, set the date on the dropdown on the 4th of September, and went through with the order2 days later they phone up to inform me that they have cancelled my order WIITHOUT MY CONSENT and tell me to start again with the date for the 10th, but they had already told BT i was switching on the 4th, so BT internet set end on the 4th, Vodafone want me to move the date to the 10th, what am i supposed to do for the 6 days with no internet, are your employees stupid? dont' cancel my existing broadband if you cant start yours on that same day, what a joke, sheer incompetence, if they are gonna mess new customers around before the plan even starts, dread to think how much of a hassle they'll be during a plan."

Can't cancel an order I never received/ Avoid this company.,"I ordered home broadband and a mobile phone plus plan , the mobile phone was delivered to an old address, and returned to Vodafone.I then spent 6 hours over three phonecalls trying to cancel the mobile phone and phone plan that I never actually received.A week or so after I then receive a welcome email telling me about the mobile phone and plan I have spent hours trying to cancel.Which means I have to once again phone up Vodafone customer service and painstakingly go through the same process off trying to cancel everything again.Vodafone 'I do have a life to get on with ! ."

vodafone  shabby way‚Ä¶of collecting revenue,"VODAFONE telecom footpads highwayrobbers who put dick turpin to shamegas lighting corporate bullying and premeditated theft.Date of experience 28th august 2024 ,  ;- when i recently tried to log a complaint about gross misleading information given to me by an agent of vodafone  using my land line telephone i got a contact number for vodafone from their corporate website for customer complaints  which was answered by an autobot which invited me to press 5 to speak to the operator, i quickly discovered this diverted my call to a premium call number which proposed charging me ¬£6 per minute, at which i promptly hung up. Never have i encoutered such a shabby attempt to steal money by a vast immoral and ethically challenged international company on a deviiously named customer care line.  this is premeditated systematic fraud  designed by some free range moron of a systems designer.the question arises has  vodafone ltd  got a death wish? or just some disgruntled employee determined to raze the company to the floor. there seems to be a growing trend amongst companies and goverment departments quangos and agencies to distance the public from their officers and accountability surely there should be a duty of candour? the case of vodafone surely requires the urgent attention of the telecoms ombudsman and a review of their fitness to hold a telecoms licence? Not being the type to back away from conflict i would like to solicit views and experiences of others. please feel free to comment at any length you like"
the worst network i have seen,the worst network i have seen don‚Äôt do with them contract they rob you.
Cancellation,"As had numerous missed calls today while at work, upon searching the number, it is with regards cancelling my account with Vodafone. The reason why is detailed below.Took a new phone on contract, after a while it developed a fault, so returned to the store. They sent it away to the service department, where it was claimed to be unrepairable, so instead they sent me a refurbished phone of the same model. That was the only thing that was the same, the condition of the replacement phone was not as good as the faulty one I returned, and bear in mind that when upgrading this has an affect on the value when trading in. It was because of being fobbed off with an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù product that made the decision for me to change service provider. The after sales service is what badly let you down, and why I will no longer use Vodafone."

Literally the worst customer service‚Ä¶,"Literally the worst customer service I've ever had to deal with.  In July we ordered a home broadband package from Vodafone to be installed on August 12th.  Engineer came, installed everything, and left.  We've had no internet since then - over two weeks.  We've spent hours on the phone to Vodafone customer service who repeatedly claim that it is about to start working.  When we tell them that is what they said yesterday, and the day before, and the day before, and the day before, and so on, they simply repeat that it is about to start working.  When we ask to speak to a manager they refuse, when we ask why they are telling us the same patently false thing over and over again they simply repeat that it is about to start working.   Vodafone is, without a doubt, the worst company I've ever dealt with.  Horrendous."
Vodafone used to be a great company.,Vodafone used to be a great company. Used them for atleast 25 years or so. But for last 2 or 3 years.. I feel like it's a bit of a scam company..  with horrible customer services.. and regulations that leave you wondering what you paid for in the first place.. truelly horrific service these days. I can't see it getting any better.. borderline fraudulent service.. pay and fet nothing in return. Vo.e to think of it so far you won't see Vodafone even bother unless you write a a negative review. Responds quickly to bad press..  yet provides a shocking experience..

Unfortunetely the old copper line was disconnected so no internet for 9 days until Open Reach came a second time to fix. I get mistakes happen but what was worse was the customer service in India. Spent 3-4 hours on the phone talking to their chatbot Tobi and customer service before the issue was resolved. Then the auto compensation failed to be reflected on the bill and yet more hours wasted. Writing this now literally 2 hours into a chat with them now. They keep offering me a ¬£5 Morrisons voucher instead of my compensation.

Terrible service from Vodafone,"Terrible service from Vodafone, we have tried on multiple occasions now to change the account holder name from my mothers to mine (even though I pay for the account and have done for the past 10 years, I also manage my account through my own ID checks on the app). We have been in to store, and been told to ring a number to do the verification checks and this has now failed twice because the information they have taken down has not been sufficient to change the account holders name. We have wasted so much time on this process and had quite frankly a despicable service from Vodafone. We are still no further forward with a fourth call being made today to do the ‚Äòrelevant identification checks‚Äô. Such poor customer service, I am now looking to change contracts and go for an alternative provider. Really disappointed."

Well deserved compliment.,"For all the bad press sometimes given to the mobile phone sector, the Trowbridge Vodafone store is the exception. We have used them for our domestic supply of various family phone contracts over many years and always been impressed by their quality of service. We had cause to visit last Saturday for some advice on an irritating issue - it was quickly and expertly dealt with by Emily who went the extra mile to help. Well done Emily!"
Online Customer services. (Telephone),This company would be alright if they hire people who can speak English correctly!! Absolute joke man how can you get anything sorted on the phone when you can‚Äôt understand them. 1 women sounded like she was standing in the middle of Heathrow runway and the one today kept saying ummmmm arrrrrr‚Ä¶. Ummmm‚Ä¶.arrrr. Seriously before you hire these people get them to call you and see if you can understand a word they are saying! Absolute joke. I even had one women say she didn‚Äôt know how to help me as she couldn‚Äôt understand me? What she can‚Äôt understand kings English?? Imagine working customer services on the phone and not being able to understand English! My god sort it out!!!
I spoke too soon,"So after problems with the installation at my parents property - OpenReach remedied the connection isssue. My ederly & vunerable parents were up & running with their Fibre 150. VOIP is included with Vodafone & a new phone number was assigned to the Router. Ideally I wanted to keep my parents original phone number (I didn't request this when placing their order for Fibre150) but was told that I could still 'port' across their old phone number & that it would take a couple of days. Seeing as they get a lot of phone calls from their hospital & GP surgeries I thought porting the number would be easier for them! Turns out it can take up to 10 days - which I only found out after constant phoning of their customer service line. But it's now 12 days, no update, no communication from Vodafone whatsoever - bearing in mind that my parents account is marked as vunerable due to their age & health circumstances. Vodafone's staff are always polite & try to help - but the company aren't giving their teams the ability to solve these problems. Why is it taking so long, obviously something is wrong? Why if an account is 'vunerable' is it left for me to continually chase (but not get anywhere)? Why are service companies not looking after customers properly? It's not good enough -as I have stated all along - my parents wellbeing is all that matters to me - You all have parents too - would you like them to be treated this way? Please could you look into this matter for me & get in contact as a matter of urgency - Thank you"

Service is great.  Scheduling an appointment sucks.,"Service is great.  Slow, but great.  Speed of service has nothing to do with employees;  it‚Äôs the system they use.  My only issue is gettin an appointment.  You can‚Äôt make one on the UK Vodafone number as they don‚Äôt have the capability.  You can‚Äôt just walk in and get helped because you have to be in the system for them to do so.  The number provided for the store by Vodafone customer service is out of service.  There is no published number for this store and it‚Äôs the only one within 90 miles of me.  So, I have to make a an hour and a half round trip just to make an appointment and then do it again once again for my scheduled appointment.  It‚Äôs almost like this tech company need to to hire a tech firm to sort out their issues."
Vodafone Nightmare,"Tried to register a new phone and pay for a ¬£15.00 bundle and was told my email address was already in use with another account - I don't have an account with Vodafone. I tried few times to no avail.  After a 'chat' with a robot I 'chatted' with a human being. Great. I need help. Vodafone put me through to Howly - seems you aren't getting help from Vodafone you are getting it with Howly for a nominal fee of ¬£1.00. Until you get an email from Howly saying you've paid ¬£25.00 subscription fee - now waiting for that to be refunded. I worked out that the problem was my proper email address was being refused but by chance I typed it all in lower case and it was accepted. (weird!)  I got as far as payment for the bundle, the card was declined, twice, and then my own card was declined. Seems Howly could access payment but Vodafone couldn't. I eventually got human help at Vodafone who wanted to 'speak' with the customer - my mum who, I explained, is not well, is 96 and profoundly deaf so I'd have to do all the questioning and type in the answers anyway. Couldn't go any further as because of their security set up, they have to 'speak' to the customer. I understand needing the security and that it is there to protect but I was the one giving them information. They don't have a set up to cope with elderly frail customers who are unable to follow their security protocol and find it impossible to use a computer. I do know I could have said OK and done it myself but I said no, I was so fed up by then. Took 2 hours of my life I won't get back.  And just to put the top hat on it - I got an urgent text from the Natwest Bank - because the card had been declined twice they were querying regarding a possible fraud and had temporarily frozen her card. They unfroze it once they received the reply. I said goodbye to the nice Vodafone man who tried to help but couldn't. I won't be using Vodafone again I'm off to Virgin."
scam that you can't cancel,"scam that you can't cancel, 1st: It was said free to transfer when you moved.When i moved (in 2022), they said there is a technical issues and i was forced to cancel old one and open a 24-month contracts (and more expensive!)now 24-month has come and i just need to cancel my contracts, they ask you insanely large number of  securities questions to ""PROTECT"" you from fraud (what kind of fraud would help others to cancel the service?)No client service and my stomach come back again because of their empty promise, poor service and no way to cancel the contract!avoid at all cost"
Vodafone broadband bad experience,"Broadband installed Thursday and then spent 2 hours on their web chat as their app wouldn't work and the booster wouldn't work. Gave up after 2 hours. Saturday visited a Vodafone store and they were limited what they could do. Sunday spent over 3 hours on 3 different calls trying to get the app to work, as I couldn't access my account in any other way, trying to get the booster to work, plus the internet connection kept dropping.  And the solution is to send me another booster and wait up to 7 days before the app works. Finally got onto a 3rd person and can access an account online (on a PC) and the best bit is I already have a bill for ¬£39 for 3 days service! Dreadful service. Hope the new CEO Max Taylor will actually focus on customer service, rather than using the words to make himself sound good. So, I have spent over 5 hours trying to get a simple broadband service. Do I get paid for this, as not my job. Dreadful overall experience."
Tariff changed without my permission,"I am using Vodafone for me, my wife, and 2 children. I chatted vodafone to close my son‚Äôs line. Because we don‚Äôt need it. They said they will make a discount if I don‚Äôt do it. I asked many times if my tariff will be effected from this. I said I am using my data plan in Turkey free 25GB, and I want to go on using it in Turkey free. Asked many times. The guy told me it will go in as it is now. But I am in Turkey now. It charges ¬£7.39 per day. The worst thing is, I trusted him and didn‚Äôt check it. Today I saw that there is already ¬£67.48 additional charge.I changed my tariff to a more expensive one at least to save next days. But I recognised now it is limited to 10Mbits speed. :( I want my previous tariff and for sure don‚Äôt want to pay the additional charges.Vodafone, why do you do this? I am your customer for 4 years and now I am disappointed. Whenever the commitment finishes, I will close my lines. Not my son‚Äôs one only, I will close all of them.Thanks to be an untrusty company for your 4 years long customer."
Friendly and knowledgeable,"Abi was extremely helpful today when I switched over from another mobile service and got a new phone.  She was very knowledgeable and answered all the questions that I had. However, because Abi was so good and forthright at her job,  it highlighted an issue with a different member of staff that my wife dealt with the previous day. This experience will be given in a different review by my wife,  as Abi deserves five stars."
Communications company who fail to communicate!!,"I called but couldn‚Äôt complete the task and the chap said he would call back the following day.Two days later and no one bothered to call.I tried their customer service number, which didn‚Äôt connect ‚Äì three times, so I called the sales number and spoke with Darren. I explained what I wanted and was told he needed to transfer me to a different team, which he did. This was an overseas call centre and the lady I spoke with hardly spoke any English, asking the same basic questions several times. I eventually asked to speak with a UK based manager. I was placed on hold for several minutes and when she came back, she ended the call. I called back and spoke with Sara who told me what Darren said was incorrect!!You really need to get your act together!!!"

Tied to contract without my knowledge!,"Gutted to be writing this to be honest as Vodafone has never been an issue previously. I went to a Vodafone store in March to look at deals for new phones (mine was coming up to 4 years old, I'd finished the original contract and at that point was on a Sim only plan). After having a chat with the guy, I ended up keeping my phone and taking out a new Sim only plan which was cheaper for me. I was told that I could leave this at any time when I was ready to get a new phone. Yesterday I received a new phone that I had ordered with a new contract (this was bought through mobiles.co.uk but with a Vodafone monthly contract). I was understandably excited and spent a good couple of hours setting this up and transferring all my stuff across. Upon ringing Vodafone to end my old Sim only plan, I was told that I was actually bound to a contract until March 2026!!! If I had known that back in March, I wouldn't have taken out the plan as I knew I would need to replace my phone pretty soon! I was told on the phone that my only options were to pay the early exit fees of over ¬£200 or to return the new phone, to cancel the new contract and to then upgrade at a later date - which will cost more money per month! So I now have to go out of my way to resolve this situation by returning the phone etc AND end up paying Vodafone more money in the long run, even though it wasn't my error. Make it make sense that a loyal customer is being punished and expected to fork out more money despite intending to keep their custom with Vodafone? I'm really disappointed that I was essentially trapped into a contract as they would have likely known that my only options would have been to upgrade (and therefore pay more money) or pay the early exit fees (and therefore pay more money!!!) I can't even take my custom elsewhere as I'm stuck in the contract! Terrible customer service."

Refusal to refund unused and non activated SIM,Makes it incredible difficult and borderline impossible to be refunded a wrongly charged contract for a sim that was not even activated or used. Multiple efforts through both vodafones phone lines and voxis webchat where neither wanted to hold responsibility. Was deflected again and again over the phone with hours of my own time spent trying to retrieve ¬£13.50.Automated direct debits which had to be manually cancelled. Very deceptive and do not honor what previous company employees tell you over chat.

Half the speed they promise,"After spending an hour on the phone with Vodafone trying to help with my speed issues they tell me that despite paying for a 900 line the speed I should expect 450.i didn‚Äôt I sign up for 450. I signed up for 900 and that‚Äôs what I paid for. I could get 450 at virgin, for 2/3 of the price so. They decided to send me a booster, even though my speed issue is a network cabled Speed issue. Anyway the booster arrives I plug it in. I scan the QR code and follow instructions. It takes me to a page where I should select my equipment type. The booster is not listed so how am I supposed to install this booster? The QR code on the booster when  scanned says no data available and there‚Äôs nothing in the app that helps. I have a booster which I can‚Äôt connect and a 350 speed when I Should have eight or 900 I cannot wait to get out of this contract with Vodafone. I‚Äôm also going to end my phone contract too. Amazes me what a good ratings they get on here. Virgin media you literally plugged the booster in and it connects no issues at all at virgin media you get the speed they tell you you‚Äôre going to get 99% of the time. I‚Äôm definitely going back to virgin media Even if they‚Äôre slightly more expensive."

This means that we are now having to pay for two providers simultaneously until we can leave Vodafone.We appreciate that some people have no issuse with their service, but we will not be returning to this provider in the future. Our experience has been terrible!"
"So shady, so bad.","I‚Äôm at the end of my rope with this company.  Horrible coverage that, when I had 4 bars or more used to offer about 100mbps down.  I switched my broadband to them and the same spot with that coverage is now *coincidentally* maxing out at the same speed as my home broadband.  This company has the worst coverage, nothing but excuses, and are so incredibly disorganised.  Add to that 0 interest in improving service.  I thought o2 was bad coverage. Vodafone is just as bad with everything else being worse.  These companies need to be regulated out of existence.  There‚Äôs no doubt the ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù plan is throttled on a local tower in my opinion. Central Greenwich gets about 3mbps and all they do is offer a signal check.  Well no, thanks, it‚Äôs on 5 different devices.   Awful awful awful."

I have not had WiFi for four days, I have been on the phone with them for hours on end, engineers have come out and all I get is the blame game, if it‚Äôs not Vodafone blaming Openreach for the incoming line then it‚Äôs Openreach blaming Vodafone‚Äôs equipment. I pay for a service, I have been quite loyal to Vodafone but that obviously pays no dividends. So now all I want to do is cancel the contract, can‚Äôt even get that done. Tired of the promises."

Zero stars if I could do,If i could give zero stars i would do.How do people make such a big mistake and not apologise for there mistakes.I would not recommend this shop at all infact I would say stay well away so much so having to take it to ofcom to sort things out with a phone that is less than 5 months old
Words fail as does the service,I have vodafone WIFI in one of my rental properties and want it my own home. Simple you would think. But not for Vodafone. I simply wanted one that my business pays for and one I will pay for myself to keep the payments totally seperate. Vodafone cant manage to do this unless the first payment on the new account comes out the account that pays the existing direct debit. So it is a new Broadband account at a different property but somehow Vodafone cant seperate them until the are set up. The total call lasted 1 hour 10 minutes and I would suggest 45 minutes of that time I was on hold as everything had to be discussed with the supervisor. It is clearly the incompetent being led by the even more incompetent and despite all of this I have received a contract and installation date without finalising the payment details. They probably think they will simply take the money from the existing account and hope to get away with. I have a 14 day cooling off period from the day of activation and as they wasted my time I will allow the instalallation and the delivery of their equiptment and cancel at the end of the cooling off period. It works like this these companies waste our time so we should recipricate in kind.

Had a very difficult conversation with‚Ä¶,Had a very difficult conversation with customer services who did not understand the nature of our problem which was that they had restricted phone use as plan limit had been exceeded due to an international call. However we kept being told it was due to excess data usage which did not make sense. After 45mins on the phone with an unintelligible and rude customer services representative we established that we had to pay an extra ¬£75 immediately in order to resume our service. This was actually due to an international call. We asked for proof and were told that we had to wait two weeks to review the bill to determine whether it was correct.The customer services person kept talking over me and accused me of the same but was not listening as we could not understand what he was implying. He threatened to terminate the call. We subsequently found out that we are paying double that of any other service provider for a sim only contract. That‚Äôs what you get for 20 years of loyalty! We will changing provider.Great to get a response but I‚Äôm not on social media how can I contact you

The parody goes on!!,"After leaving a one-star review (wish I could give less), Vodafone responded, suggesting I contact their representative. I had already filed a complaint about the poor network and signal inside my apartment. Initially, they acknowledged the issue, stating it was a known problem in my area that couldn't be resolved anytime soon.However, when I reached out to the representative they suggested, suddenly, there was ""no known problem"" in my area. Instead, they advised me to check my mobile device. When I mentioned their earlier response about the known issue, they claimed they couldn‚Äôt see anything like that. It‚Äôs both laughable and frustrating.It‚Äôs disappointing that I still have credit with them that they refuse to refund, leaving me stuck paying for services they can't provide. Stay away from this company! By far the worst customer service, not to mention the consistently poor signal and network at least in my area (Leeds, city centre)."

All this confirmed by text and e-mail. Surprise surprise next day again I received a call to say the contract had been  rejected but they would call later to rectify matters. A further wasted afternoon was spent trying to  complete the deal by a helpful individual but wasclearly frustrated by the barriers faced by a system not fit for purpose.

After constant asking, she then started reading out the offers online which I could have saved the trip and done myself.  Ended up upgrading to a plan that was not at all any beneficial from my previous one. Really annoyed and upset by this whole store experience and wish I never upgraded in store. I later got home and called Vodafone to cancel the plan I had just upgraded to.

"If you value your sanity, please save yourself the rage inducing experience of trying to get broadband with Vodafone.","If I could give 0 stars I would. Where do I start?I chose to go with Vodafone for broadband as me and my partner are both on their phone plans and have never had any issues plus we appreciated the customer discount. Well if only I knew then what I know now...I selected the broadband package I wanted and checked out, the activation date was about 3 weeks from the day I placed the order which in itself was annoying but I moved past it as it seemed like the best deal.About 2 days before our connection was due to go live we'd still not received our router so I got my partner to ring and ask what the delay was only for him to be told that our order was cancelled due to an internal issue at Vodafone. Bare in my mind, Vodafone DID NOT tell us this until we rang them, so if we didn't ring we would've just never been told? From there, they made us place the order again over the phone where they re-took our details (this is important) assuring us that the router would be delivered the next day and made live on our original connection date. The router did get delivered but that was just the start of the problems. Aside from the fact the router is the clunkiest massive eyesore I've ever seen, it was an absolute nightmare to set up with about 4 different booklets of instructions just to get the thing working. In the end, the port which came with the router was a ADSL modem which doesn't fit in the standard Wi-Fi port in most homes, so we had to go out and buy an adapter just to plug the thing in. Having lived 3 weeks with no Wi-Fi we were desperate for it to go live but low and behold when we connected the router it didn't work. The connection was NOT activated. So on the phone again we went to Vodafone, ""Why do we not have a connection?"" we ask, to then be told that... OUR ORDER GOT CANCELLED... AGAIN!Never mind that they cancelled our order and didn't tell us for a second time, the question on our lips was WHY did it get cancelled?! Oh that's right, it was because the order was placed with my partners title as 'Master' instead of 'Mr' and the system didn't accept it. But wait... if we recall back, the second order was placed over the phone, we weren't the ones typing the details in, the Vodafone employee was... so yet again we are left Wi-Fi less because of Vodafone's incompetence. At our absolute wits end with this situation and this company, we then proceeded to spend another half an hour on the phone with the advisor to be told that we will now have to wait a FURTHER 2 WEEKS, for them to activate our connection. If you value your sanity, please save yourself the rage inducing experience of trying to get broadband with Vodafone."

After a couple of attempts of trying to do this online to no avail, in despair I went into the Market Harborough shop. Akash sorted this out for me. He went beyond the call of duty as there was a problem with my account. It took him three attempts (no fault of his) to eventually sort it out. He even stayed 10 minutes after hours to sort it. He was a real star! I would certainly go back to this shop if I had any other queries!"

She was able to cancel debits and set up a monthly plan at the same cost with absolute friendliness and efficiency.Data and 'Additional costs' are significantly cheaper than our present plan with EE.We will transfer our house Broadband to Vodafone in two months time, when our contract term comes free.Olivia was an absolute pleasure to deal with, and technically competent.I am 77 years old, an electronics graduate, and well able to judge people."
"Spotty Wifi that cuts out regularly, terrible customer service team.","The wifi is pretty spotty and cuts out I'd say for 5-10 minutes a day sometimes twice a day (this is across 2 different houses in 2 completely different places) The contract came to an end on June the first. I contacted them and told them I did not want to renew my contract IE continue with the contract. Fast forward 3 months and I've noticed in my bank statement that they have charged me for the past 3 months even though I said I did not want to renew. Then when I contacted them they told me auto-renewal is different from canceling my broadband and I needed to submit a formal application for cancellation (I was never told this on the chatbot) and they will not renew me but that's different than canceling. I then spoke to 3 customer service agents who told me they'd be able to refund me retroactively and apply my notice period from the 15th of May so I'd still have to pay for June which is fine. I then get to the fourth person and they say that is impossible and they will charge me one last time in September. Case in point look at the reply, absolutley useless"

Worst Experience Cancelling,"Where do I start? I've been a happy customer of Vodafone for a number of years. However, there's been a few instances where service has fallen below expectation.That is what ultimately led me to today when I'm cancelling my contract. I've had multiple conflicting messages from Live Chat on how to do this and when is best to use my PAC code. The agent I'm currently on the line with has ignored every question that I've had and asked me mid response what broadband provider I'm with?? What does that matter when I'm in the middle of an issue?I'm now in the situation where from what I've been explained:1. I could cancel my contract early, use my pac code to take effect on the contract end date, but pay an early termination fee. 2. I could use it today (contract end date) but it's not being actioned for 4 days, meaning I'll be charged for those 4 days on a rolling basis. 3. cancel my contract today and lose my number. All of these are horrible customer experience and taking advantage of your position as a network provider."

Vodafony,"After a two year plan we decided to change provider. This was for a few reasons, poor connection, poor speeds when promised a set amount, evenings the internet would turn off and ai customer service. Trying to cancel online we were given the usual ""we can match that"" spiel but after saying no they then got passive aggressive with every comment. They then took ages and put us on hold, they then essentially called us stupid for not taking the ""better deal"" and at the end of the call we were polite and said thank you, we got NOTHING in reply! Vodafone burns bridges apparently. I understand they have to try and keep you but poor customer service using hard sell tactics will not keep a customer! The facts are, we found a good deal with a FIXED rate. We were over charged by vodafone for 2 years as proven but the promises when leaving."

Vodafone is the best ever mobile network provider,I have been with Vodafone most of my life and I am now 50. In 2007 I went from Vodafone pay as you go to a Vodafone monthly contract and I was on Vodafone pay as you go for many years before that. I absolutely love everything about Vodafone and I will always be loyal to Vodafone and stay with them for many more years to come. No other mobile network provider will ever come close to Vodafone. Even though my monthly contract is quite expensive but as far as I'm concerned it really is worth every penny. I have never ever had a problem with Vodafone. They have the best ever customer service and fantastic customer offers. There is still no 5g coverage yet though but that will never be a problem to me as I'm sure they are working hard to get full 5g coverage to everyone and I will always be patient and wait for however long it takes as I know they are working hard and that's all that matters. Every year when my contract goes up in price Vodafone kindly inform their customers that the yearly price increase is necessary and that we as customers are investing in Vodafone with our yearly price increase. That sounds absolutely perfect to me as I really am more than happy to invest in such a brilliant mobile network company. They are and always will be number one out of all the mobile network providers.
If I could give it 0 stars I would,"If I could give it 0 stars I would. We have been without wifi for over a week, and Vodafone have said they can't come and look at it until at least another week and a half later. As two of ny daughters work from home, and one of which their office is over a 3 hour drive away, she has been forced to take annual leave. I have spent the last two hours chatting online with their customer service, who then out me through to a ""Manager"", only to be told there's nothing more that they can help me with. Their customer service is appalling, and they try to fob you off until you eventually give up and exit the chat.I will be looking to change provider ASAP, as Vodafone have failed to provide us with wifi for what will be about 3 weeks or more. Hugely disappointed customer."
Top class service,"After spending about 4 hours over 3 days on the phone to customer services to sort delivery of new phone and activation of SIM for my daughter, I decided to try and get some sensible advice in my local store. Luckily for me, Harvey took on board all my issues and frustration and literally resolved a very stressful situation within 5 minutes. He is quite simply a total hero and has the customer at the forefront of his advice and service. Thank you Harvey for going above and beyond to ensure that you resolved our issue. We are very grateful."

Openreach have been out 3 times said there is no fault on there end. 3 days off work waiting for openreach countless hours on the phone Still no Internet. I just want to cancel the contract at this point and go with another provider but they will not let me out of the contract. These big companies sign you up to contracts take your money and do not provide the service you are paying for. Avoid Vodafone

Disastrous Vodafone broadband/landline upgrade,"The engineer 'upgraded' my Vodafone broadband and now my landline doesn't work for incoming calls and my cable connected devices (PCs and TVs) don't work at all. I wasted an hour on the Vodafone chat which ended up telling me it will take 2 days to fix. I was also locked out of the Vodafone app. Absolute rubbish service.UPDATE: I was subsequently given fantastic assistance by 'Aye' in Vodafone Broadband Customer Service. She patiently went through checking the set up then when it was clear some things needed more time she offered to call me back the next day, which she did, then corrected and clarified a few things and now its all working. Well done Aye, she is a star!"

Disgusting behaviour,"After 20 years as a customer, including paying a ridiculous device fee for the past 3 years, these cowboys are saying that a cancellation fee on an airtime only contract is going to be ¬£442. Airtime only, there is no phone attached, I was not given a new handset, and yet the contract is ¬£36 a month? How is this different from a sim-only deal? Why on Earth is there such a disconnection fee?This level of customer service is to be expected if you are looking to sign up with Vodafone - I could not recommend this network less to any prospective customer."

The WORST support experience of my LIFE!,"Our subscription got cancelled without our consent, and we fought hard to get our old contract back for weeks and weeks. After ca 20 interactions with customer support and no broadband for 6 weeks, we decided enough was enough. Having to explain over and over the entire saga, with all its twists and turns, anew to every single support agent is utterly unacceptable ‚Äî I've been a support agent myself, and taking notes + reading the previous agents' notes is absolutely KEY and NOT HARD, which the vodafone agents failed at every single time. Throughout the process, we also found that their communication not only failed us, but also OpenReach and other broadband providers. Seemingly a big issue of theirs. Furthermore, they refuse to fully refund us for this absolute nightmare, as they charged us an ""early termination fee"", although this was completely unwarranted, as we'd been with them for 3 YEARS! Treating loyal customers like that is honestly repulsive. They withheld ¬£18 and gave us 0 compensation, and I simply don't have it in me to argue anymore. I'll happily pay ¬£18 to never ever have to deal with this joke of a company ever again. Please, I beg of you, DO NOT CHOOSE VODAFONE. You'll regret it when problems arise."

Awful & stressful,"Had to cancel a new contract & get my pay as u go back because they kept messing up the switch over even though they promised its so easy. Lost my ¬£5 credit for the switch over, then when PAYG reinstated, the phone line was cut off again after putting a new ¬£5 credit on, then 24hrs later they cut the phone off again, reinstated after another 45min l/line call to them losing my new credit I had put on the PAYG once it was reconnected, now put on a new ¬£10 credit. In all it's cost me ¬£30 in L/line costs, ¬£20 in phone credit, ¬£5 in new contract charges for a sim I never used cause it didn't work & they advertise they the ""nations favorite"" - nope. Very stressful & I've had to revert back to my original PAYG, shocking, never again, never recommend.I don't use social media as listed in their reply. I tried to register on Vodafone app for my PAYG, app wanted 30 digit password, but didn't work. It's just embarrassing - I'm never contacting Vodafone again, an absolutely hateful company & terrible experience"

It's fine until something goes wrong,"It's fine until something goes wrong. Then the nightmare begins. I used to get 58 up and 18 down on my Vodafone landline broadband. I arranged a new contract with them and suddenly the speed was only about 52 with a minimum guaranteed of 49. Six weeks ago I noticed the speed had dropped to 42 down and 9 up. I got in touch through the ""chat"" option on the website. Be aware that whether you phone or ""chat"" you will end up to talking to someone overseas and you WILL be on the chat/phone for 50-to-60 minutes every time. While they fiddle about, disappear for minutes at a time and generally behave as if you have all the time in the world. During one call when I mentioned how long it was taking the cheeky staff member told me ""just get on with your work while I do it""! However I was at home hanging about on the phone. I'm actually losing track of how many times I've been in touch now. I think the total is about three-and-a-half hours on chat and phone (or is it four-and-a-half?). The latest being 50 minutes on the phone today. The latest practice is they want to send you a link to turn on the camera on your mobile phone so they can see your set up. They will have you crawling around on the floor trying to remove the cover of the phone socket while webcamming the whole thing. It's like something out of a Victoria Wood sketch 40 years ago. As if they're doing everything they can to humiliate you. No matter what happened during the previous chat/call they will have you starting from scratch every time. For example today, despite a BT Openreach engineer visiting just over a month ago, confirming the low speed with his device and Vodafone saying in an email there was a fault with the line, today I was once again on the floor trying to remove the cover and webcamming the socket, because they ""can't"" do anything without this procedure. After the BT engineer visited the speed dropped further to about 38 down and 8 up and nothing at all seemed to be done. Three days ago I tried ""chat"" again and asked about cancelling the service which I'm entitled to do without penalty after 30 days below the guaranteed minimum speed. Wrongly I was told if I did there would be a penalty fee of about ¬£85. In frustration I wrote and posted a letter. Almost immediately the broadband became unusable. The broadband connection disappearing completely every few minutes with no ip4 signal. It was almost as if someone had sabotaged my line after the call. After two days of that I tried ""chat"" again this morning. The neighbour across the road has a connection of 76 down and 19 up with Vodafone. Another on the same side of the street, also with Vodafone, has 37 down and 8 up, like me. There seems to be some sort of issue with the line on the street. But guess what? This morning they wanted me to webcam the phone socket again. So I'm 62 and crawling around on the floor behind the desk trying to show shots of the socket. I did manage to get the cover off at last. But of course it's all absolutely pointless bureacracy because BT Openreach confirmed over a month ago with their equipment plugged into the socket that the line speed was low and Vodafone itself said in an email there was a line problem. And the neighbour has a problem. But the people on chat and phone just ""can't"" do anything without doing the whole procedure again from scratch. So it was another 50 minutes wasted.And even then the conclusion was that we have to wait and see until tomorrow. Even though the line has been dropping out for two days and when it works the speed is well below the guaranteed minimum. Weirdly a month ago the low speed was reason to bring in BT Openreach. But now apparently it isn't. So I have another call to look forward to tomorrow. The connection has already cut out once since the call. What planet are these companies on where they think customers have hours of time to spend while these ""support"" people fiddle about doing the same thing over and over?Of course it is a choice for any business to run its support in this way and no accident... Is it all deliberate psychological ""punishment"" to deter customers from complaining?So this what you have to look forward to if things go wrong... If you read this Vodafone DO NOT ask me to contact you on social media. RESPONSE TO THE REPLY FROM VODAFONE:I gave in and contacted them on Facebook chat. They have just asked me to phone the usual broadband support number which will no doubt take me down the one hour ""let's just test everything again"" rabbit hole! I would like the government to start prosecuting companies like this that deliberately put customers through this psychological pain. When MPs return I will talk with my Member of Parliament about Vodafone's ""service"".  As quickly as possible? BT Openreach visited more than a month ago."

I got absolutely nowhere with the customer service team who were rude and several calls were dropped, I don't want anyone 2 go through the frustration and stress which I have been under, I was compensated for the time periods without a device, however I did not feel that Vodaphone had any empathy regarding my situation as I needed my phone for personal reasons, therefore I cancelled my contract yesterday free of charge due to the inconvenience I have had."

Mobile not too bad Broadband is Horrendous!!!,Drops out several times a day and really slow in the evenings.

Everything Wrong with an ISP in One‚Ä¶,"Everything Wrong with an ISP in One Package.I've already complained about Vodafone around 18 months ago, when it took more than 150 days to activate Broadband that was supposed to be live in 10 days. As is the case now, that was caused by general incompetency, outsourcing of their team and lack of communication.Our street's internet went down (we live on a rural street with only 14 houses on it) after an OpenReach update to the Green Cabinet. The entire street lost connection and we all reported to our respective Internet Service Providers (ISPs). All did their usual checks and then quickly escalated to OpenReach, who have been at the box daily for the last 7 days re-connecting houses one or two at a time. We're now the last ones still offline and Vodafone refuse to escalate to OpenReach.I reported this a week ago. I've had to do numerous calls and video calls with their team, each time making me video myself unplugging the master socket, plugging in a DSL Splitter (which I had to purchase myself for ¬£8!!!!!), turning off and on etc.Each time the same result. I have told them on every single contact point (c. 12 times now) that two senior OpenReach engineers working at the box can see the fault, and need them to escalate to OpenReach for a job number to resolve, just as every other ISP has. Vodafone's response is for after 5 days, to have the UK internal team call to say they can see (after several more plugging in and unplugging episodes) a fault in their system which doens't require OpenReach. This was Sunday. I was told to wait until Wednesday because although the fix should be instant, I have to wait 3 working days! Wednesday comes around and surprise surprise (not!) no internet. I've now spoken with another support agent (no longer the UK team) who has had me unplugging and re-plugging everything again, and now wants external photos of the house because apparently there's no fault with our equipment or line, but because the test results show the OpenReach line working, there's a fault somewhere on our line (despite Vodafone saying there isn't themselves!).I am absolutely beyond exhausted with this. Best of all the '4G Ultra Backup' which is supposed to 'seamlessly switch to 4G if the internet goes down' doesn't work - completely useless.I have given Vodafone 24 hours to find a remedy or I will force them to terminate my contract at the 18/24 month mark. Completely unacceptable. Shoddy, unprofessional and completely useless. Stay well clear if having an internet connection you can depend on without having to wait weeks everytime there's an issue is important to you.UPDATES:> Within 1 hour of posting this Vodafones Social team 'reached out' to offer me a direct way to speak to the team. I did this, and after a few hours I've been told the social media team can't help and I need to continue through the same rubbish support channels as before, so this is just a PR stunt to look responsive. If only Vodafone could fix faults as quickly! Queue the promised call never coming, and instead I've been back and forth with a colleague on web chat who initially said an engineer was booked, only to then say the fault was fixed, then to decide it would require a response tomorrow from someone else.

Another lonely day in Paradise,"Another hair tearing and totally frustrating, totally negative experience with vodafone today. they've changed me from a social tariff after 12 months to a higher one even though I still qualify and I asked to remain. Trying to talk to some electronic 'erbert was totally useless and phone contact number not even ringing. Without doubt the worst broadband provider I've ever had the misfortune to use with multiple calls over the last 12 months to report internet connection issues with no positive results. guess I'll have to bite the bullet and return to a standard broadband with a reliable provider and pay the extra. I guess it will be worth it for the sake of my mental health"

DO NOT take out any contracts with Vodafone!,"DO NOT take out any contracts with Vodafone! Without a shadow of a doubt, the worst collective customer experience I have ever received. Expect to pull your hair out with extreme frustration!I took out a 24 month contract for a 5G unlimited Gigacube. Over the last month, I started noticing significant issues with upload speed / drops in connection. I spent HOURS on the phone to Vodafone to try to identify the problem and went through all the hoops only to be told there wasn't anything they could do and that - even though several members of the technical team agreed that an average of 1Mbps upload speed was unacceptable, it was 'performing within the parameters i.e. 0.5Mbps and 50Mbps' as per my contract. I complained as well as showing concern about falling outside of the '14 day return policy' but was told not to worry by one of Vodafone's technical support team as 'normally they allow 30 days for returns and can make exceptions given my poor experience to date'. I did some further investigation and found that the speeds dramatically increased... if the Gigacube is placed outdoors. In short, this device DOES NOT work well indoors. I have also recently found out (through my own investigation) that the Gigacube has a strict NAT type and thus is NOT fit for purpose for certain times of gaming, contradictory of the very generic statements advertised on their website about how fantastic it is for gaming. It didn't help that half of the technical advisors I spoke to didn't have a clue about this and weren't able to provide adequate support.Following my investigations, I contacted Vodafone again to discuss cancelling my plan and was told I could not. I explained this isn't what the previous advisor had said and had to go through the painful process of having to repeat myself for the third or fourth time at this point. I was left under the impression that I was locked into a 24 month contract with a product that simply isn't good enough and this whole situation has had a dramatic impact on my mental health (I'm due to start a new job soon and will need good enough upload speeds for video calls). It was at this point that I disposed of the packing, thinking nothing of it (more on this later).I finally managed to speak with someone who spoke with their manager and had the call in question listened to. A few days later, I received a call back saying a manager had approved this and I could end my contract without having to pay an early cancellation fee, thus admitting they were at fault. I was busy at the time of calling and asked for a call back this week to discuss further - it was confirmed that this would not impact the offer of leaving the contract without having to a pay a fee. A call back was arranged for today.Prior to today's call, I spoke with Vodafone,0 explaining again that we don't currently have Fibre installed in our property but this may be coming sooner than we thought and that perhaps a monthly contract may be more appropriate. I was told by one of the advisors that I could speak to retention and very possibly something could be done to reduce the price, but only after my 24 month contract had been cancelled.Fast forward to today's call. We were working through the cancellation when I advised I no longer had the packaging. I have now been told that this means I can't cancel my contract and will remain locked in to a 24 month contract. Even after all of the above - all of the time wasted, repetition, hours of my time, finding inadequacies and faults in their product, I have now been told if I can't return the item in it's original packaging then nothing can be done. I am receiving a call back from a manager within 24 hours, but the advisor said the manager will tell me the same thing. Absolutely ludicrous! Even the advisor themselves sympathized and said they understood the frustration. With all the focus on fair treatment of customers of late, this is a complete and utter violation. Not only have Vodafone given me a product that doesn't work properly, they're not training their teams properly, their customer representatives aren't recording notes at an appropriate level and the customer is suffering!I will update once I hear back from a manager!"

I feel like I'm being hounded by‚Ä¶,"I feel like I'm being hounded by endless Vodaphone reps. It's a total nightmare (especially when you're dealing with your own other personal issues). On the phone (overseas call centre) for hours and hours at a time without resolution. Then you get another call, repeating same and still 1.5 hours on yet another call. Then you're told a manager has to investigate and call you!! I want it to STOP!! This is all Vodaphones fault. They closed our account. They think we closed it (hence investigation) but why would we, if we wanted to transfer the account to our new home??? So they set a date for installation. Then days before they've cancelled! And now stating we cancelled. Why?!I don't want ANYTHING more to do with this company!! What has happened to the customer service since we first took out our broadband with this company, to what's happening in past couple weeks? It's dire!! So much going on in people's lives and we have to give over our precious time to this nonsense.I've made a formal complaint and hope this is last we now hear from them all Edit : I cant believe it!! Yet another message to say someone else calling me on 2 days time! When will this end? *ive blocked the number.Edit. 1.15 hrs again today on social media messenger. After passing security explaining situation we're in, I was then told they can't speak to me because my social media account name is different to my actual name!!! You simply can't believe it. How many millions have slightly different social m names to reality?! But there we go. Vodaphone terminate the chat. And this was the chat stream they recommend for help. It's unfathomable how this company operates.Sending a reply to this review with 'sorry ended this way' doesn't even help me as it's NOT ended!! I live for the day when it has. See above my exoetievcd with your social media team. 2024 and this is how things are."
Even 1 star is too much,"Absolutely horrible and worst customer service I've ever experienced! This company does not care about it's customers whatsoever. I was a long term loyal customer and I felt I never got rewarded for staying year after year. Recently upgraded to a new plan and got disconnected without a network for 2 weeks. Spent hours every day phoning, live chatting and going to different shops, trying to agree to a new deal, while they cancelled all my attempts to sign another deal. Nobody seemed to be able to help with my issue, saying I have to wait till the all mighty Vodafone system gets around to sort me out.4 weeks later and still no help. I complained and was offered some compensation which I agreed to because it was better than nothing. No sign of it. Empty promises! This company happy to take your money, provide no care and make your life difficult. Don't waste your time and money with this company!"

Give Darren a promotion!,"I never usually write reviews but this time I felt it was needed and deserved...I have been with ee for the last 11 years but over the last year I have had issues with signal and general lagging from their service whilst paying a high monthly cost.I met Darren a few months ago before knowing he worked for Vodafone and he told me about how he had no issues with the service. I spoke to a few friends who agreed. After having a reminder that my contract was due for renewal I decided to look into changing to Vodafone after looking at the reviews online, so I popped in to see Darren to see what he could do for me. Straight away, he was able to beat the price I was paying with ee AND offer me MORE for it. I also opted to look at changing broadbands as again, I was having issues with another provider with lagging and glitching. Darren was once AGAIN able to help find me a better deal by saving me more money (I like that!) and have more for it. Darren is an absolute asset to Vodafone and they should be very proud to have him working for them. His kindness, knowledge, and support is what mades his excellent customer service stand out to me. He made the anxiety of changing providers easy and less stressful and nothing was too much, so I am very very grateful to him. It's taken a few months to get me to switch after lots of messing about with going to and throw, but I took the plunge and I'm so glad I have, so Thanks Darren for all your help, I'll be returning to you once my son's contract is up for renewal :) Darren deserves to be promoted where possible or at least a bonus of some sort! xx"
Horrific experience,"Ordered a contract with vodafone (not a smart move) cancelled it after two days. It is 4 months later and despite spending hours and hours on the phone I have been sent letters and threats from debt collectors. I have been told 4 times that I have sorted it out and not to worry only to get more letters. I have tried calling, going into shops, using the online chatbot, online chat with a person, for some reason there is nobody that can take an email. I am at my wits end. I am still getting letters. I will never use vodafone and will be praying on their downfall."

Lucky escape- AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"Engineer turned up to fit my broadband.. took one look outside and obviously decided the job wasn't for him. Proceeded back to his van where he sat for an hour and reported it as a missed appointment. Astonishing considering we said hello through the window unless he thought I was a lurking spirit. Vodafone refused to help me, offered me a 48 hour call back which never happened. On second attempt to contact them I was promised they could help me by offering me a second appointment in 2 WEEKS. I am spending ¬£5 a day on data just so I can work from home and explained this to them but was told 'don't worry we will sort it'. I then told them to cancel as I no longer wish to be associated with Vodafone if this is the behaviour on my first ever experience with them. I was then told by an agent after repeating myself 5 times 'sorry no speaking english..' pretty much the cherry on top of the whole thing wouldn't you say. I was then told they couldn't cancel at the time and was promised another call back which again didn't happen (shock) so I have cancelled my direct debit and they won't be getting a penny from me. I guess when they realise I still have their uninstalled router this will get them moving and wanting to speak to me. Can't express enough how laughable this whole experience was and how glad I am of the lucky escape I had."

Duped into a contract from PAYG,"Several years ago I purchased a Vodafone 'Pay as You Go' dongle. After having several months of difficulties topping it up, I entered a Vodafone shop and requested assistance in topping it up. I was advised to set up monthly payments via direct debit. I was assured that it was not a contract I was entering but an easier way of topping up. After disregarding my dongle several years ago I have received a debt collection agency letter stating I owed over ¬£250+ for a breach of contract despite me never intentionally entering into one. It appears Vodafone set up a contract for me despite me having a PAYG dongle. I have spent yesterday and all morning trying to resolve this issue but it appears I was duped by the shop worker into taking a contract without my agreement (I bought a PAYG and intended it to stay that way). Instead Vodafone insist I had a contract (which I did not) and I now have a debt collection agency pursuing me. Vodafone Customer service is appalling particularly when you have a valid grievance. I have left Vodafone and would advise never to touch them should you have a legitimate grievance.It appears from Vodafone's response that I go to their social media pages for resolution yet I have spent all morning speaking to many people/robots trying for them to accept I did not enter into a contract. Why would I enter a contract if I purchased a PAYG? I have been a loyal customer for 25 years but would strongly recommend new customers not to open an account with Vodafone if my experience is anything to go by."
You couldn't make it up,"I applied to Vodafone to provide broadband services at a property I'd completed the purchase of the previous day. Despite having a perfect credit history and the highest possible credit rating with both my bank and the major credit referencing agencies, I failed Vodafone's credit check. I asked if it was because they'd credit checked me against the new property, where I wasn't yet registered as living and they refused to confirm. I appealed and sent them a copy of my Experian credit report. Their response was to infer that they could see information that credit reference agencies couldn't see. This alarmed me, as my professional work depends on my having an unimpeachable credit history, so I asked them to elaborate, which they refused to do. I then managed to establish, via a Subject Access Request, that they held no information about me that credit reference agencies couldn't see and, in fact, the reason for failing the credit check was because they had indeed checked me against the new property, where I wasn't yet registered as living. I made a complaint about their processes and at the end of the process, they concluded that the only person at their end who'd done anything wrong were the Subject Access team, who apparently should not have divulged the reason for the credit check fail. So, the team that I, as a customer, thought had done a brilliant job, the team that resolved all of my worries, is the team they're going to investigate for not following company policy. You couldn't make it up."

Think long and hard before switching to full fibre,"Signed up for fibre broadband and it wan't made clear how much disruption/ ugly wiring and ugly boxes would be involved outside and inside the house- plus I need to get a extra socket sited ( at my expense) so router and fibre box can both be plugged in.They have to be next to each other unless the householder organises and installs their own longer ethernet cable between the two.   None of this was explained by Vodaphone. City Fibre who did the installation were informative and helpful but pressure was applied by comments like "" copper lines are being phased out so it will have to be done at some time"". Ultimately I now have an unsightly brown box on the outside of the house  and an ugly set up on the wall inside with a large  freestanding white router in a situation that is not what I wanted but the alternative was running cables along the hall round 2 doors, across the stairs,through a doorway, along a wall, and round another door. I will also need to plug the landline phone into the new router which is not where I want my phone. Plus have just realised phone has a plug as it has an answer machine is I can't actually use it any more Didn't think of that one and no one explained it in advance. Very dissatisfied with outcome of switching to full fibre.PS trying to get through on phone is a nightmare- clearly set up to prevent every obstacle to speaking to a human being, including demanding aPIN which I have not been given"

Was meant to have broadband activated‚Ä¶,"Was meant to have broadband activated on the 2nd August, this should have been a straight swap as the sky broadband worked fine.Eventually they sent a openreqch engineer who identified the problem was the router was faulty, now you would think Vodafone will send a new one out, nope I have to wait 3 more days for something they do in background and then they might think about sending me a router out. What is point in sending a engineer out of you are going to ignore him.This was broadband for my dad so now we are nearly 3 weeks where they have left a pensioner without broadband or a phone line.The customer service is awful and put you hold and won't answer simple questions. And solution I to reset router about 100 times.On their online forum and on here they tell you to contact them by social media, who will not help either so they waste your time again.Unfortunately I'm stuck waiting for them to sort this but this is disgraceful behavior.Edit: Vodafone are now telling me it will be 28th until the fault will be looked into, by this time it will be 4 weeks with no broadband.Do not use these."
My experience with Vodophone is‚Ä¶above,"My experience with Vodophone is completely unbelievable, they have repeatedly lied, and deceived me.  One of the less serious things they did was increase my contract by 73% without both my permission or advising me of the increase.  I took a litany of complaints to OFCOM and was advised by them that they had looked into this, very serious complaint and upheld everything I said but were powerless to act on it!! It is no wonder Vodophone are allowed to behave in such an unscrupulous, dishonest and frankly illegal manner if there is no governing body able to defend customers treated in such a fashion. . No proper staff training, management are dishonest, ruthless and care only about profit margins. If I could give minus 10 ratings I would.  Avoid like Monkeypox in if you value your sanity."

Broadband not cancelled at my old house so received a double bill which I apparently need to pay as it can‚Äôt be rectified until next month when I may (not holding my breath) receive a corrected bill with a refund.. remains to be seen. Customer service agents are rude and unfortunately in spite of trying, the English is really difficult to understand.

Vodafone has been extremely misleading,"Vodafone has been extremely misleading. They advertise good coverage in my area, but once I signed a contract, the service was very poor and almost non-existent. I tried canceling within the 14-day cooling-off period, but by the time they issued the PAC code, I had to go on a pre-planned holiday, and my line was moved over just five days after the cooling-off period ended. Now they're charging me ¬£550 for a termination fee, despite my multiple explanations of the situation. Avoid these rip-off companies. Go with cheaper options that provide better service and respect their customers' rights."

My broadband contract with Vodafone was coming to an end in June/early July, so I thought I would upgrade as the timeing would be ok. Placed the order with my broadband supplier Vodafone. It's now 18 August and my supplier has informed them that they cannot install after 3+ months. because of so called access problems. Openreach haven't been to site once or contacted me. I am now out of contract and my supplier Vodafone have cancelled my Full Fibre order and now charging me out of contract rates. The Communication between both Vodafone & Openreach is a disgrace."

Disappointing customer service,Unfortunately over several days was met with not very helpful staff. Today in store when trying to explain elements of phone plans. However the young person who was meant to help we were met with rude and condescending attitude accompanied with very passive aggressive behaviour. Abit disappointing as been a customer for a long time and they've always been helpful until today. When explaining information it might be worth understand people's frustrations rather than being passive aggressive towards paying customers.
Vodafone chat line is dreadful,"I recently signed up Vodafone for new high speed broadband and all was going well until I received a call from someone on a very bad line who said that they were having problems my last supplier and had therefore cancelled my contract.I spoke to my last supplier who told me what to tell Vodafone to do in order to resolve the matter.I spent ages searching for phone numbers and tried 4, all of which sent me round in circles and couldn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt put me through to a human being.So I tried the chat line and after some time, I was transferred to an agent rather than dealing with a computer.I then spent over 2 hours being pushed around from place to place and chatting with 4 people, all of whom had to read the chat all over again, it was without doubt the worst service I have ever received. I will now find someone else.Vodafone need to think about their customers first and scrap chat lines and use well trained personnel who are capable and equipped to handle these queries.NOTE:Since reading the response from Vodafone, I see that Vodafone invite me to make contact through Facebook or X, neither of which I belong to or use, so not very helpful. Perhaps if they operated helplines with well trained people?"

Fiber optic really it's the worst‚Ä¶rubbish broadband,Fiber optic really it's the worst broadband I've ever had tried umpteen times to speak to there experts and nothing has been resolved. 12 months to go of this nightmare!!!! Won't be back really unhappy can't even watch a film .
Fine when things work when they don‚Äôt shocking!,I have been with Vodafone for many years and they are now making me switch to fast fibre. They booked me an appointment ( sending 50 million reminders) and it went horribly wrong. I had a blocked duct which resulted in engineers snapping snapping the copper wire and as a result I lost all broadband never mind fibre. 3 engineers later still no broadband. They advised me they were coming out the following day and didn‚Äôt turn up even though I had taken emergency time off work. They then said they didn‚Äôt have availability to fix till the following week. I went to work the following day and they just turned up! My stress levels were through the roof! As I was told the blockage may be in next doors! Vodafone initially showed compassion ( after 5 different calls to Indian call centres) but since have dismissed the complaint as Openreach have dismissed it! Completely denying an engineer was coming out the following day. I  still don‚Äôt have fibre! I have complained but they are now saying the complaint is closed as I quality for ¬£6.10 per day! when nothing has been addressed. It‚Äôs shocking! Thank you for your message - I am sorry but I can not get the link to work. Maybe you could contact me in the old fashioned way either by phone after 6pm or via email? Ref 116817671
Vodafone put me in a financial hardship‚Ä¶,Vodafone put me in a financial hardship due to being made redundant from work and I asked Vodafone to help with a repayment plan to which they didn‚Äôt also I am putting in a claim due to irresponsible lending also this corrupt company sells your debt to smaller companies for a small price and they claim for the full amount to which my credit file would show they shouldn‚Äôt have borrowed to me. So I am putting in a claim due to irresponsibly lending and I will be claiming for full cost due to these putting me in financial hardship. When I asked Vodafone for payment plan I only had 3 months left on my agreement which would be around ¬£300 and now they have sold it to debt agency it is now at ¬£1000. This has played a big part on my mental health and I will be pursuing this like you have me with debt agencies and not looking at my credit Vodafone.
Just wanted to leave a review on here‚Ä¶,"Just wanted to leave a review on here after my exceptional experience today at Vodafone in Horsham today. The colleagues were all very accommodating and my experience with James in particular was very good. I came in to set up a new account with James as I had previously been with O2 and was very unhappy with their service, but was pleasantly surprised with how helpful James and the team was with helping me set up my new contract. Would definitely recommend Vodafone after the experience and I am very happy with the deal we agreed on it has all the things I need and for a good price and my services is already better."
What can I say,"What can I say, the reason I have stayed loyal to Vodafone for all these years is my local store manager Liam (stockton on tees) who always goes above and beyond to help me even with menial tasks like helping me with phone storage or logging back into my Vodafone app and always does so with a smile on hes face. Today was one of those days my phone screen decided to go off for no apparent reason, so I went down to the store and unfortunately for Liam I was a bit of a mess as I was panicking as I'm on the transplant list and need to have an open phone line for that very important phone call coming through. Liam knows my story and has always asked how I am and is always tentative with all customers I see, this is a massive positive I see in customer relations it just makes you feel valued. Well today Liam calmed me down gave me some tissue and sorted me out very quickly with a phone so I could get that very important phone line back active. It may seem like a little thing but that was the whole world to me as I wait for that life changing phone call.  I think Liam is an asset to Vodafone, keep up the good work pal üëè"

Oh My.,"Oh My.I can't BELIEVE some of the negative reviews I have just read for Portsmouth's Commercial Road branch.I got my new phone there a couple of months ago.

Stay away from Vodafone and read my review as to why.,"Firstly I stupidly updated a contract with Vodafone after calling to get my code to transfer my numbers. Everything was great with the upgrade of the phone‚Äôs. Then it all started to go in a spiral downward direction. So I had the latest iPhone and realised my watch was 5 generations behind so I went online to upgrade and collect at a local store. Easy hey? No! After chasing my order as the updates weren‚Äôt happening I was told my watch would be ready to collect after 4pm. I went along just after 5pm to be greeted by a very helpful assistant who was training. He went to get his colleague from out back to assist me and came back and said he wouldn‚Äôt be long as he was using the toilet. No problem we all need natural breaks. After about 10 minutes a lady came in and said she wanted to take out a new contract, the same assistant said just a moment I‚Äôll go and get my colleague as he did with me. He went out back and his colleague appeared came to me asked me if I had the correct ID and I replied yes I did. He walked out to the back room and when he came back said It‚Äôs just arrived and to come back in 30 minutes as it needs to update on the system. I explained I had a doctors appointment to attend and wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it back before the store closed and then was told to come back tomorrow I explained I was going away the next day for two weeks and he just shrugged his shoulders and said well it will only be held for a week so the order will be cancelled. I‚Äôve never heard such rubbish and receive such bad customer service. He wanted the new contract rather than just hand a product over that he probably wouldn‚Äôt get commission for. After quite a few phone calls I was assured the order would be cancelled. The following day I went into a store in Cwmbran in Wales and had great service and got a watch. Then a week later my partner wanted a watch so I went online to order one and signed contract etc and had confirmation that it would be delivered on Friday. Received no more information so again went online to chat to them to be told that it had been rejected but never bothered to tell me. After a long telephone call I was told it had been cancelled as they had no stock of the watch. Couldn‚Äôt give me a reason as to why I was not notified. Trying to speak to anyone with this company is very difficult as it just keeps sending links to their website. To make this worse the watch for my partner was a 25th anniversary gift and I had to get up this morning and try to explain this. Yes it sounds like a made up story as an excuse but fortunately they know what the customer service with Vodafone is like and fortunately believed me. I‚Äôm still trying for the watch but guess what customer service can‚Äôt source one or check the system for a shop that has any in stock. I wish I experienced this before my 14 day opt out of contact but sadly I‚Äôm stuck with them for  3 years. I could type more but I hope you get the idea what awful service I received."

Horrendous to deal with,"Horrendous to deal with. I moved and tried to take broadband with me. Vodafone insisted on a new 2 Yr contract. I was happy with that. However,I have not had any connection since it was set up and spent over 8 hours in 3 days on the phone with them, I went through the process of what was advised, was told it was a connection issue at their end and would be rectified within 45 mins, 1-2hours or whatever they felt like saying- and I would receive a call back- this went on for 3 days. After this I called back asking repeatedly to be transferred to cancellations as within my rights and was refused. I was also refused details of a customer relations, complaints dept phone number, email or postal address as ""there was no need to make a complaint"" Sadly every call was to an overseas agent who point blank refused to deal with my legitimate concerns and the one time I passed the phone to my brother in law the agents attitude transformed as he was now dealing with a male. I went into the local store and whilst the staff at folkestone vodafone are outstanding, friendly and helpful, they were also fobbed off on the phone- I heard them discussing this with incredulous reasons the overseas agents were giving as to why I couldn't cancel.Do not go near this company!"

Stopped service for NEO watches,"I want to express my deep dissatisfaction with Vodafone recent decision to discontinue support for NEO Smart Watches. As a customer who invested in this device, which cost me ¬£140, I am dismayed to find that it has now been rendered practically useless.The NEO Smart Watch was marketed as a premium product, designed specifically for children, with features that justified its higher price point. Many of us purchased these devices for our children, expecting them to have access to the advanced functions that were promised, including real-time GPS tracking, calling, and messaging capabilities. These features were key selling points and were integral to our decision to trust Vodafone with our purchase.However, with your decision to cease support, the watch has been reduced to nothing more than a basic, cheap kids‚Äô watch, lacking any of the functionality that distinguished it from far less expensive alternatives. This is incredibly frustrating and feels like a breach of trust between Vodafone and its customers.The discontinuation of service without a viable alternative or compensation is not only disappointing but also feels like a disregard for the customers who have invested in your products. A device that was once valued at ¬£140 is now worth almost nothing, and this abrupt change leaves us with a costly piece of obsolete technology.I urge Vodafone to  offer fair compensation to affected customers. As a long-time customer of Vodafone, I sincerely hope that you will take this complaint seriously and work towards a resolution that reflects the trust and loyalty your customers have placed in your brand."

I would give 0 stars If I could,"I would give 0 stars If I could. I'm trying to come away from Vodaphone, my mobile phone contract is ending and I have tried to call and sort, but have been directed to the TOBI online chat. My experience with this the worse customer service experience that I have ever received. From explaining what I wanted and didn't want anything but the process to end my contract, The advisor ""jack"" tried to cross sell and upsell me everything (pay as you go, broadband, media packages) other than giving me my PAC code so I can leave Vodaphone's service. I had to ask him 4 times to stop trying to sell me something other than what I wanted and was very polite about it but it went on and on and the conversation went on and on, which is either a failing with the individual or Vodaphones retention policies. This then ended up with a ""red outage"" which I was told a system wide error and I would have to come back tomorrow. If the advisor had just cut out the up/cross selling when I had asked 5 minutes into the conversation I could have my PAC code and been on my way. Instead I was kept on for 45 minutes where in the outage happened at approx the 30 min mark. This is tantamount to not allowing me to change provider which is compensational by Ofcom. I was promised an option to download the chat, which I then also couldn't. This experience, along with the patchy service, ever increasing yearly prices and clunky app with 0 realistic achievable rewards have made sure I will never give Vodaphone my business ever again and if ever asked I will steer people away from at every opportunity."

Terrible broadband,my home broadband was changed over from sky on the 12th August. I have had issues with speed and coverage since the changeover. I rang customer services and got passed from pillar to post for nearly two hours with no solution other than trying to sell me more equipment or package. I asked to be transferred to cancellations and got cut off twice. All I want is the speed and coverage I pay for.

To my embarrassment, my credit was declined with no explanation, and I was told I could fill in an appeal form, so first I borrowed a phone and called them, to which I was told to try again in November or fill in the form so I emailed the form to my surprise they emailed me back saying they could not confirm my identity I have a passcode to log and pay by direct debit, but they want a copy of my bank statement I don't get the logic give these a miss as loyalty does not exist with them so just applied to some other provider who was more than happy for my business so told Vodafone I was cancelling and all they want is to take more money from my account what they cant verify"

"Friendly, efficient, expert and personable.","I find the prospect of any interaction regarding phones, sims, upgrades, top ups, megabytes and the such like a daunting prospect at the best of times. I am not fluent in ‚Äòphone‚Äô, have no idea what a megabyte is, nor do I understand the concept of data usage. So my trip this morning to the Vodafone store in St Austell for a data only sim for a TP LINK booster box was nervously made with the recited information I was given to remember. The shop was busy and the two members of staff were serving the customers sat in front of them. Whilst aware of the newly arriving customers, we were told that the wait could be up to 30mins and if a return later would be better to take it or to grab a seat and wait. I chose to wait. I was seen within 15 mins and expertly, efficiently and sympathetically dealt with by Ian. I remembered my script, asked if this made sense and Ian was able to offer me exactly what I needed with further suggestions to perfectly fit my wifi boosting needs. He was aware of the building queues and was professional throughout ‚Äòmanaging the expectations‚Äô honestly of the new arrivals in the shop. A huge thank you to Ian. I will now be looking to upgrade (I believe the term is) my dramatically aging phone at Vodafone in Exeter when I return from holiday. I‚Äôd thoroughly recommend this Vodafone branch."

Confusing,"I left Vodafone and got sent final bill reminders. I was sent this two months after I left without being sent it originally. There were 2 emails a day. Both with different amounts. No explanation as to why.I had to call to be told by a very unpleasant agent that this was due to extra charges for overseas calls. Fair enough, but why are you sending this over 2 months after I left Vodafone as a payment reminder 2 times a day with two different amounts (turns out it is somwhow both added up together) without sending the bill before at all.The agent was able to send me a payment link over text message whilst on the phone but said it would take up to 10 days for the payment 'if I had enough money in the bank'. What a condescending way to talk to someone. And why does it take 10 days?Abbhorent."

Total Shambles (or is it)!!!,"Well, what a shambles. I have been with Vodafone for a number of years on their broadband packages. I will not be renewing next time!As part of the many emails I received from Vodafone I saw an upgrade was available to me. This was to upgrade from full fibre 500Mb to full fibre 910Mb, for just ¬£2 per month. Beware, this sounds great, however there are some big downfalls with this.I was told that my existing equipment would be all good to take the new speeds.I got the upgrade within 3 days and had speeds in to the house of around 960Mb.So all good?No! The WiFi was still at exactly the same speed as when I was on the 500Mb package.I got in touch with the online chat to see what was going on and finally got through to a person to talk to.From this conversation I was told that because the speed in to the house was correct all was fine and there was nothing to do, unless I upgraded to a higher package with an additional ¬£12 per month over my existing 500Mb package.Does this seem like a hook to get people to upgrade and then hit them with a bigger monthly payment? I think so.I was told the newer equipment with boosters would increase the WiFi, as I had a lot of devices on the WiFi.I tested this by removing the majority of devices off the WiFi, running a speed test. This made no difference at all. All I could assume from this was the equipment I had, and was told would be fine, was not up to the job.To be clear I was not expecting the full speed through WiFi, however I would have expected a marked increase, especially as I performed the tests whilst directly by the side of the router.I advised that I wanted to come out of the cooling off period, reverting back to my previous contract. This I was told would be done.I asked that I receive confirmation that my previous contract was back in force, with the same price and end date. I was told that Vodafone could not send emails, only text messages. Maybe Vodafone need an upgrade to their systems to allow this? Anyway I received a text to confirm this, and I was told to ignore any other information thatI had emailed, as this was automatically generated.All went back to the previous speeds, and I thought that was an end to it. Unfortunately not!I received a bill today which is in line with the 910Mb plan. Checking my online account I saw that not only had I been charged for a full month at the higher rate, my old package had also gone up in price. Why?I spent over an hour on an on line chat with Vodafone, where the advisor told me I had additional documentation and this was the price of the new contract. I informed the advisor of the previous communications. All they could offer is that I call the office. It took three attempts to get through, as two of the numbers they gave me were not valid. What a waste of time this chat was! They could not even discuss this within the organisation and transfer me (where is the customer service).I finally got to talk to an advisor and I then had to go through the whole story again. After much conversation I am now at the old payments. I have asked for confirmation that the old contract is still in place. Again this can not be done via an email, due to Vodafone's policies, so all the advisor could send is a text, however as they have an outage this could not be sent, so I still have no guaranty that all is as it should be.I have emphasised throughout my conversations that I need confirmation on my contract and that an email confirming all current information should be sent, however Vodafone have no intention of doing this, which I think is very poor and stinks of trying to pull a fast one on its customers.Very poor and disappointing."

My Vodafone plan was coming to an end and I purchased a new Vodafone plan & phone from a 3rd party (who as far as I can see did not offer the option to upgrade my existing number to a new plan).I had a lot of confusing information initially from several people at Vodafone about how to transfer my old number to the new plan.

Kafkaesque nightmare.,"The area in which I am seems to have a 5g problem and the internet does not work. I rang them to establish whether it was the case and what was going on. After being on hold for 9 minutes pressing buttons I was given an automated message saying to visit their website which does not work of course as the internet is down! I then rang again and with their automated voice recalls I finally got to someone. I then sat on hold for 15 minutes while I have no idea what was being checked. I was then cut off. I then received a text message saying they could not call me back but the line had dropped. I then spent another 25 minutes on hold calling back AGAIN. Its almost Kafkaesque. I then come on here and I see the only way to contact them is on Instagram, Twitter or the like. They are a mobile phone provider. What is wrong with a phone number and person at the end of the call?"

I‚Äôd tried to upgrade myself on the app and via the online chat but didn‚Äôt find this helpful. The advisor didn‚Äôt give much information or options. So we decided to go into a store and I‚Äôm so glad we did! The store assistant (Tom) listened to what we were looking for, provided options and recommended what would be best for us personally. We were getting three new phones and SIM deals which took quite a while to set up but nothing was too much. Rather than us waiting, Tom got his colleague Daria to help too. They were both so personable and friendly and really made us feel valued. I went back yesterday to drop off the old phone as part of the trade in deal and received the same level of excellent customer service by Tom‚Äôs colleague (I missed her name) and Tom was there to say hello too.

5 stars for Jasmin & Luke,"I went into the store after being told that it would take 3-5 days for the tech team to get back to me. I could see that the store was understaffed, I had to wait around 30 minutes which ended up being worth the wait. I initially spoke to Jasmin and then Luke, with them both helping throughout the FOUR hours I was in store. I would just like to thank them again for their patience and determination to resolve my issue, which eventually was the outcome. I think it's unfair to see people complaining on here re the store being understaffed, surely you would need to direct that to Vodafone directly not the specific store. 5* service in my opinion form Jasmin and Luke thanks again"

Well, 4pm rolls around on Monday and still no signal. Funny enough, my old network provider disconnected my phone, leaving me completely stranded. So, I contacted Vodafone to get some answers. What did they do? Blame my old provider for disconnecting my service too early! They even had the audacity to tell me to contact my old provider to sort it out. When I did, my old provider explained that the reason for the disconnection was because Vodafone had already activated the PAC code. This means my number should have been active and working! Back to Vodafone I go, using my work mobile because‚Äîthanks to Vodafone‚ÄîI‚Äôm left without a phone now. And, as you might expect, Vodafone blamed my old provider again, claiming there was an issue with the transfer file and assured me it would be completed by midnight. Tuesday morning, 9am‚Äîstill no activation. Cue another excruciatingly long call to Vodafone. Not to mention the obstacle course of pressing 100 buttons just to reach an advisor who was unprofessional, calling me ""darling"" and asking ""are you with me?"" when clearly they had no clue what was going on. Another hour wasted on the phone and I‚Äôm told there‚Äôs yet another error in the transfer, and guess what? It will take another 48 hours to complete! I asked to speak to a manager, only to encounter someone who was unhelpful, uninterested, and unwilling to assist. When I requested information on how to file a complaint, the call was disconnected! Moments later, I received an email informing me a complaint had been filed on my behalf‚Äîwithout even disclosing what was said in the complaint! Then there‚Äôs Adele from the complaint department. She emailed saying she would call between 2 and 4pm without even checking if I was available. I wasn‚Äôt. She called again after 5pm, and honestly, she might as well have been a robot. All I heard was, ‚ÄúAt the current moment, we are working to resolve the issue,‚Äù repeated like a broken record. It‚Äôs now Wednesday, a full six days after providing the PAC code, and still NOTHING. I have no phone to use, my old number is in limbo, and my Vodafone number has never worked. I‚Äôm about to go on holiday abroad on Friday, a fact I‚Äôve mentioned to them multiple times. I‚Äôm also undergoing medical treatment and need to be reachable by the hospital‚Äîbut Vodafone apparently thinks it‚Äôs acceptable to leave me stranded like this. Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget‚Äîthey‚Äôve already sent an email saying they‚Äôre going to charge me one month upfront for their non-existent services! No, thank you, Vodafone. This is going straight to the Ombudsman, and I‚Äôll be sending this review to every management email I can find. Your service is a total joke! Save yourself the headache and avoid Vodafone at all costs."

The worst company I have ever dealt with.,"The worst company I have ever dealt with. Absolutely shocking customer service. Early June I took out a new contract with Vodafone and took advantage of their phone part exchange scheme. I was promised a postage label to return my old phone which never arrived. It took 4 phone calls and approx 90 minutes of my time to receive one.  I returned the phone on 2nd July and was promised a payment of ¬£325 for this within days. Despite endless phone calls to customer service I still have not been paid. I have spent hours of my valuable time being fobbed off and transferred to other departments for the past 6 weeks, something in the region of 5 hours of phone calls and online chat. I won‚Äôt be renewing my contract as Vodafone are clearly not fit for purpose. What a disgraceful business this is."
Amazingly helpful staff,"Chloe and Dan in the Exmouth Vodafone shop are the epitome of true customer service.  Amazingly knowledgeable, patient and helpful with every single customer - and they had a lot of customers the day I was there sorting my phone upgrade."
Pressure sales and poor customer service,"Signed up to broadband after being pressure sold into extending my broadband contract (I contacted them after receiving time for upgrade messages,  etc.). Changed my mind after being confused by contract terms (all within the same web chat) only to be told I am unable to cancel at this time. Contacted them again after returning from holiday only to be told I am now outside the 14 day window. Nowhere in the contract does it state that I am unable to cancel on the same day as signing up. Also be aware, Vodafone have not signed up to the communications ombudsman. I would also question how a company with 38% of 1 star reviews is able to generate a score of 4.4 on trust pilot."
Having caused irreparable water damage‚Ä¶,"Having caused irreparable water damage to my phone I went to Vodafone in Cirencester for help. I was served by an extremely helpful assistant, Ollie, who sorted my problem out. I cannot praise this shop enough."

Very helpful Staff - New SIM sorted!,I went into the Waltham Cross branch to set up a new VOXI sim and Charis helped me get it sorted. Excellent service and a very quick process!
Fantastic,"You have absolutely lovely staff, so pleasant funny and helpful. Annabelle and Kams in particular really helped us, we had a lot of questions to go through and they were just amazing. Kams (Kamran) provided a very good and helpful Vodafone experience, it's quite unusual today to find such excellent,  knowledgeable and pleasant staff. Look after them üòäüëå"
Superhero staff,"I visited vodaphone in st Davids Cardiff. I first me Sharon who was very helpful and professional. There were some issues with my order and Dave Watson sorted things out very swiftly. This gentleman has many virtues, in addition to being extremely knowledgeable, he was polite and kind. He has a very reassuring manner and nothing phased him, I felt entirely confident in him. A really great experience with exceptional staff who treat customers with respect."
Amazing,"This morning I was attended by Roma customer service at the Arndale shopping center. She is a lovely person, who has helped me with everything I needed (pay my telephone bill, cancel one of the lines I have and contract internet service for my home). It is a worker who dedicates time to the client's needs. I define it as: Fast, Efficient and Clarity when reporting. I have left the store more than happy, with the service from Roma. Roma, thank you for your patience and dedication."

AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"I have been with Vodafone for almost 20 years and never considered switching to another provider until today.. the service and attitude from the staff in Leicester Highcross was disgusting.I went into store for a upgrade on my existing plan (hoping they would match a deal that I saw online), but the advisor in store said it cannot be done in store and starting offering me Talkmobile deals. I said that I did not want to move over as I have discounts with Vodafone and need my roaming and extras but the advisor who was called Siva did not ask about what I wanted and kept saying we only offer unlimited plans that are half price and that he cannot do anything. I told him of a deal I saw online and he didn't seem bothered and then started offering another network.. his attitude and language he was using to communicate to me was very pushy and wasn't focused on my but his friends that were in store. I felt like there was no rapport and he kept talking to his friends that came in after me.I said I want the deal I saw online and he said it is not a real deal?? Didn't want to answer my questions and said ""I am here to sell so if you don't want this deal, I cannot help you"" so rude and aggressive in tone. I have never had a bad experience in store but today I was disappointed and left store having asked for my PAC code and moved to EE.The atmosphere in store and pressure I left from Siva has put me off buying from Vodafone directly. Always better deals unlike and the staff in store are not help unless you want to buy what they make commission off.Do not recommend to anyone. Staff only focused on  commission"

"Don't waste your money, Awful service","Be prepared for constant Indian call centre staff reading off a script and having to state same information over and over again, and nothing ever fixed! Plus constant calls from the lasting anything from 30mins to 1hr and just wasting your time.Honestly the worst service for broadband I have ever encountered! Initially I got great broadband but after 6 months they started to throttle it and reduced my speed regularly. I have constant daily cut outs which is not great if in online meetings or for gaming, and my speed still constantly drops. I have put in so many complaints but it has never been fixed and I have had to fight to get them to do anything dispite my line 'supposed' to be monitored for drops 24/7. Plus your starting price amount may seem OK but with 2 price increases this has rose to over 1/3rd of initial cost at purchase for myself.Customer service have tried to force me to upgrade stating that this will resolve everything, but when paying over ¬£37 p/m, for just broadband, that does not work there's no way I would ever stay with them."
Gave them a bad review after a string‚Ä¶,Gave them a bad review after a string of failures. They replied on Trustpilot saying I should message them on Twitter and they would help me. Another new issue comes up today: they've sent me a new sim card and booster that I never asked for. Twitter Cs no help at all and redirects me to their website help section. Unreal. I guess they will reply here and tell me to try them again on Twitter but don't believe a thing they say. Their product and tech is so bad one day a startup is going to come along and wipe out utter garbage companies like this one

Came in today to buy a new phone,"Came in today to buy a new phone/contract and to cancel an existing contract. I was served by Taz, and although I had no idea what phone I wanted he made the whole process simple and easy, was able to keep to my budget and left with a phone that day.He also called through to their cancellation team for me for a separate contract. I did not mention this but going on calls is something I find incredibly hard to do due to mental health but felt very calm with his help.He layed all information out clearly about payments/charges etc... very professional and a joy to talk to."
Vodaphone sim only,"I recently tried to get a business contract, which didn‚Äôt start off well with the web site not working and having to call up to arrange. The lady I spoke to was very friendly and a credit to your company however that‚Äôs where the praise stops. After passing all credit checks I was asked to send over my ID and proof which I understand, however I was also asked for a hand written letter with my request. Why hand written not really modern, and don‚Äôt really understand what it proves that a business email can‚Äôt. I was also asked for a questionnaire which had to be filled out as part of my credit, mmmmmm really. The questionnaire was basically just an invitation for all cold calls no thanks. Surprised really and from this have decided not to continue with application as business team really don‚Äôt want to help, oh well no love loss just expected more"
